'''Algeria''',{{efn|{{IPAc-en|audio=En-Algeria-pronunciation.ogg|æ|l|ˈ|dʒ|ɪər|i|ə}} {{respell|al|JEER|ee|ə}}; {{Lang-ar|الجزائر|al-Jazāʾir}}, {{IPA-ar|al.d͡ʒazaːʔir|}}; {{Lang-fr|Algérie}}}} officially the '''People's Democratic Republic of Algeria''', is a country in [[North Africa]]. Algeria is bordered to [[Algeria–Tunisia border|the northeast]] by [[Tunisia]]; to [[Algeria–Libya border|the east]] by [[Libya]]; to [[Algeria–Niger border|the southeast]] by [[Niger]]; to [[Algeria–Western Sahara border|the southwest]] by [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Western Sahara]]; to [[Algeria–Morocco border|the west]] by [[Morocco]]; and to the north by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is considered part of the [[Maghreb]] region of North Africa. It has a semi-arid geography, with most of the population living in the [[Soil fertility|fertile]] north and the [[Sahara]] dominating the geography of the south. Algeria covers an area of {{convert|2381741|km2|sqmi|0}}, making it the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|tenth largest nation by area]], and the [[List of African countries by area|largest nation in Africa]], more than 200 times as large as the continent's smallest country, [[The Gambia]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Africa: largest countries by area 2020|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/1207844/largest-countries-in-africa-by-area/|access-date=9 February 2022|website=Statista|language=en}}</ref> With a population of 44 million, Algeria is the [[List of African countries by population|tenth-most populous country]] in [[Africa]], and the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|32nd-most populous country]] in the world. The capital and [[List of cities in Algeria|largest city]] is [[Algiers]], located in the far north on the Mediterranean coast.

Algeria produced and is linked to many civilizations, empires and dynasties, including [[Numidia]]ns, [[Mauretania]]ns, [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]], [[Mauro-Roman Kingdom|Mauro-Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], [[Emirate of Tlemcen|Ifranids]], [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], [[Rustamid dynasty|Rustamids]], [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisids]], [[Sulaymanid dynasty|Sulaymanids]], [[Aghlabids]], [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]], [[Zirid dynasty|Zirids]], [[Hammadid dynasty|Hammadids]], [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]], [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], [[Marinid dynasty|Marinids]], [[Hafsids of Béjaïa|Hafsids]] and the [[Zayyanid dynasty|Zayyanids]].

Centuries of [[Arab migration to the Maghreb]] since the 7th century shifted the demographic scope in Algeria. The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish expansionism]] led to the establishment of the [[Regency of Algiers]] in 1516, a state that attracted people from all over the Mediterranean, making its capital Algiers one of the largest, wealthiest, and most cosmopolitan cities in the world. Its decline in the 19th century resulted in its [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830|invasion]] by the French in 1830. The [[French conquest of Algeria|conquest]] and [[pacification of Algeria|subsequent pacification]] of the country that ensued lasted until 1903 and led to Algeria becoming an integral part of France in 1848 and home to over a million [[Pied-Noir|European settlers]]. While the native Algerians remained the majority of the population during this period, it is estimated that they fell by up to one-third due to warfare, disease and starvation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Algeria/Colonial-rule |title=Algeria - Colonial rule |website=Britannica |language=en}}</ref> The [[Sétif and Guelma massacre]] in 1945 marked a turning point in Franco-Algerian relations and sparked the [[Algerian War]] which concluded with Algeria [[Independence Day (Algeria)|gaining its independence]] on 5 July 1962 and the proclamation of the People's Democratic Republic on 25 September of that year.

The official languages of Algeria are [[Modern Standard Arabic|Arabic]] and [[Standard Algerian Berber|Berber]]. The majority of Algeria's population is [[Arabs|Arab]], practicing [[Islam]].<ref name=""AlgeriaFactbook"" /> The native [[Algerian Arabic]] is the main spoken language. [[French language in Algeria|French]] also serves as an administrative and educational language in some contexts, but it has no official status.

Algeria is a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential republic]], with local constituencies consisting of [[Provinces of Algeria|58 provinces]] and [[Communes of Algeria|1,541 communes]]. Algeria is a [[regional power]] in North Africa, and a [[middle power]] in global affairs. It has the highest [[Human Development Index]] of all continental African countries and one of the [[List of African countries by GDP (nominal)|largest economies on the continent]], based largely on energy exports. Algeria has the world's [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|sixteenth-largest oil reserves]] and the [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|ninth-largest reserves]] of [[natural gas]]. [[Sonatrach]], the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa, supplying large amounts of [[natural gas]] to Europe. [[Algerian People's National Armed Forces|Algeria's military]] is one of the largest in Africa, and has the largest defence budget on the continent. It is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[Arab League]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]], [[OPEC]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[Arab Maghreb Union]], of which it is a founding member.

Around ~1.8-million-year-old stone artifacts from Ain Hanech (Algeria) were considered to represent the oldest archaeological materials in North Africa.<ref name=""science.org"">{{cite journal |display-authors=etal |last1=Sahnouni |title=1.9-million- and 2.4-million-year-old artifacts and stone tool–cutmarked bones from Ain Boucherit, Algeria |journal=Science |date=14 December 2018 |volume=362 |issue=6420 |pages=1297–1301 |doi=10.1126/science.aau0008 |pmid=30498166 |bibcode=2018Sci...362.1297S |hdl=10072/383164 |s2cid=54166305 |url=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau0008 |access-date=22 November 2021|hdl-access=free }}</ref> Stone artifacts and cut-marked bones that were excavated from two nearby deposits at Ain Boucherit are estimated to be ~1.9 million years old, and even older stone artifacts to be as old as ~2.4 million years.<ref name=""science.org""/> Hence, the Ain Boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited the Mediterranean fringe in northern Africa much earlier than previously thought. The evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from East Africa, or a possible multiple-origin scenario of stone technology in both East and North Africa.

From their principal center of power at [[Carthage]], the [[Carthaginians]] expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a [[Phoenicia]]n presence existed at [[Tipasa]], east of [[Cherchell]], [[Hippo Regius]] (modern [[Annaba]]) and [[Rusicade]] (modern [[Skikda]]). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.

As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organisation supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.

By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army.

In 146 BC the city of [[Carthage]] was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern-day [[Morocco]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilisation, unequalled until the coming of the [[Almohads]] and [[Almoravids]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC.

After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].

For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region, Algeria is the second country in the world after Italy, home to the largest number of Roman sites and remains among the most alive and well preserved.

It was succeeded by another Kingdom based in Altava, the [[Kingdom of Altava]].

After negligible resistance from the locals, [[Muslims|Muslim]] [[Arabs]] of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] conquered Algeria in the early 8th century.

Large numbers of the indigenous Berber people converted to Islam. Christians, Berber and Latin speakers remained in the great majority in Tunisia until the end of the 9th century and Muslims only became a vast majority some time in the 10th.<ref name = jonathan>Jonathan Conant, Staying Roman, 2012, pp. 364–365 {{ISBN |978-0-521-19697-0}}</ref> After the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate, numerous local dynasties emerged, including the [[Rustamids]], [[Aghlabids]], [[Fatimids]], [[Zirids]], [[Hammadids]], [[Almoravids]], [[Almohads]] and the [[Abdalwadid|Zayyanids]]. The Christians left in three waves: after the initial conquest, in the 10th century and the 11th.

During the [[Middle Ages]], North Africa was home to many great scholars, saints and sovereigns including [[Judah ibn Kuraish|Judah Ibn Quraysh]], the first grammarian to mention Semitic and Berber languages, the great [[Sufism|Sufi]] masters [[Abu Madyan|Sidi Boumediene (Abu Madyan)]] and [[Sidi El Houari]], and the Emirs [[Abd al-Mu'min|Abd Al Mu'min]] and [[Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan|Yāghmūrasen]]. It was during this time that the [[Fatimids]] or children of [[Fatima]], daughter of [[Muhammad]], came to the [[Maghreb]]. These ""Fatimids"" went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, [[Hejaz]] and the [[Levant]], boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, made up primarily of [[Arabs]] and [[Levant]]ines extending from Algeria to their capital state of [[Cairo]]. The [[Fatimid caliphate|Fatimid Caliphate]] began to collapse when its governors the [[Zirids]] seceded. In order to punish them the Fatimids sent the Arab [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] against them. The resultant war is recounted in the epic [[Taghribat Bani Hilal|Tāghribāt]]. In Al-Tāghrībāt the Amazigh Zirid Hero [[Khalifa al-Zanati|Khālīfā Al-Zānatī]] asks daily, for duels, to defeat the Hilalan hero [[Abu Zayd al-Hilali|Ābu Zayd al-Hilalī]] and many other Arab knights in a string of victories. The [[Zirid]]s, however, were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of Arab customs and culture. The indigenous [[Berber people|Amazigh]] tribes, however, remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids). The Fatimid Islamic state, also known as [[Fatimid Caliphate]] made an Islamic empire that included North Africa, Sicily, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], the [[Red Sea]] coast of Africa, Tihamah, [[Hejaz]] and [[Yemen]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202580/Fatimid-Dynasty/2238/Conquest-of-Egypt|title=Fatimid Dynasty (Islamic dynasty)|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=29 August 2013|url-status=live|archive-date=1 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101203234/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202580/Fatimid-Dynasty/2238/Conquest-of-Egypt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_carte.php?carte=carte-05 |title=Qantara |publisher=Qantara-med.org |access-date=13 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009220925/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_carte.php?carte=carte-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=595 |title=Qantara – Les Almoravides (1056–1147) |publisher=Qantara-med.org |access-date=13 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921185314/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=595 |archive-date=21 September 2013 }}</ref> Caliphates from Northern Africa traded with the other empires of their time, as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the Islamic Era.

The [[Berber people]] historically consisted of several tribes. The two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, [[Sanhadja]], [[Houara]], [[Zenata]], [[Masmuda|Masmouda]], [[Kutama]], Awarba, and [[Berghwata]]). All these tribes made independent territorial decisions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR2|title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin Slane| trans-title =History of the Berbers and the Muslim dynasties of northern Africa | language= fr |page=XV|author =Khaldūn, Ibn|year=1852}}</ref>

As the Fatimid state was at the time too weak to attempt a direct invasion, they found another means of revenge. Between the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]] were living [[Bedouin]] nomad tribes expelled from [[Arabia]] for their disruption and turbulency. The [[Banu Hilal]] and the [[Banu Sulaym]] for example, who regularly disrupted farmers in the [[Nile Valley]] since the nomads would often loot their farms.

In 1516, the Turkish privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[Hafsids]], moved their base of operations to Algiers. They succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the [[Spain|Spaniards]] with help from the locals who saw them as liberators from the Christians, but the brothers eventually assassinated the local noble Salim al-Tumi and took control over the city and the surrounding regions. Their state is known as the [[Regency of Algiers]]. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his [[Fall of Tlemcen (1518)|invasion of Tlemcen]], [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Hayreddin]] succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|sultan]] gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. With the aid of this force and native Algerians, Hayreddin conquered the whole area between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1792).<ref name=""csa16"" /><ref name=""Mikaberidze"" />

The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544. He was a [[Kouloughlis|Kouloughli]] or of mixed origins, as his mother was an Algerian Mooresse.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Houtsma|first=M.

Subsequently, with the institution of a regular administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by an autonomous janissary unit, known in Algeria as the [[Odjak of Algiers|Ojaq]] who were led by an [[Agha of the Janissaries|agha]]. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.<ref name=""csa16"" />

[[Plague (disease)|Plague]] had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost between 30,000 and 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21, and had high fatalities in 1654–57, 1665, 1691 and 1740–42.<ref name=""Davis"">{{cite book|author=Robert Davis|title=Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500–1800|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2003|isbn=978-0-333-71966-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/trent_0116405722392|url-access=registration}}</ref>[[File:North Africa, from the ""Physical And Political Map Of Africa ... 1822"".png|left|thumb|Map of the Regency of Algiers in early 19th century]]

In 1659, the Janissaries stationned in Algiers, also known commonly as the [[Odjak of Algiers|Odjak]] of Algiers; and the Reis or the company of corsair captains rebelled, they removed the Ottoman [[viceroy]] from power, and placed one of its own in power. The new leader received the title of ""Agha"" then ""[[Dey]]"" in 1671, and the right to select passed to the [[divan]], a council of some sixty military senior officers. Thus Algiers became a sovereign military republic. It was at first dominated by the odjak; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey's instrument.

The [[dey]] was in effect a constitutional autocrat. The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671–1830) that the system was in place, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of the Deylikal government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest.

Barbary raids in the Mediterranean continued to attack Spanish merchant shipping, and as a result, the [[Spanish Empire]] launched an [[Invasion of Algiers (1775)|invasion in 1775]], then the [[Spanish Navy]] bombarded Algiers in [[Bombardment of Algiers (1783)|1783]] and [[Bombardment of Algiers (1784)|1784]].<ref name=""Mikaberidze"">{{cite book|last1=Mikaberidze|first1=Alexander|title=Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=847}}</ref> For the attack in 1784, the Spanish fleet was to be joined by ships from such traditional enemies of Algiers as [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]].

From 1848 until independence, France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and ''département'' of the nation. One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[immigrants]], who became known as ''colons'' and later, as ''[[Pied-Noir]]s.''

During the late 19th and early 20th century, the [[White Africans of European ancestry|European share]] was almost a fifth of the population. The French government aimed at making Algeria an assimilated part of France, and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900. The indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency, but in contrast to the other colonized countries' path in [[central Asia]] and [[Caucasus]], Algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human-capital intensive agriculture.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Algeria came under [[Vichy France|Vichy control]] before being liberated by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[Operation Torch]], which saw the first large-scale deployment of [[Military history of the United States during World War II|American troops]] in the [[North African campaign]].<ref name=""USMA-1945"">{{cite book |author=United States Military Academy.

Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status under the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]]. In May 1945, the uprising against the occupying French forces was suppressed through what is now known as the [[Sétif and Guelma massacre]]. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the [[Algerian War]] began after the publication of the [[Declaration of 1 November 1954]]. Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 [[Harki]]s and their dependents were killed by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) or by [[lynching|lynch]] mobs in Algeria.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7130307.stm | work = BBC News | title = French 'Reparation' for Algerians | date = 6 December 2007 | access-date = 16 November 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100420212617/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7130307.stm | archive-date = 20 April 2010 | url-status=live}}</ref> The FLN used hit and run attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war, and the French conducted [[Torture during the Algerian War of Independence|severe reprisals]].

The war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of Algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries. Historians, like [[Alistair Horne]] and [[Raymond Aron]], state that the actual number of Algerian Muslim war dead was far greater than the original FLN and official French estimates but was less than the 1&nbsp;million deaths claimed by the Algerian government after independence.

The war against French rule concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 [[Evian agreements]] and the July 1962 [[Algerian self-determination referendum, 1962|self-determination referendum]].

[[File:Houari Boumediene's Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Houari Boumediene]]]]
Algeria's first president was the Front de Libération Nationale ([[FLN (Algeria)|FLN]]) leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. Morocco's claim to [[Greater Morocco|portions of western Algeria]] led to the [[Sand War]] in 1963. Ben Bella was [[1965 Algerian coup d'état|overthrown in 1965]] by [[Houari Boumédiène]], his former ally and defence minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]]; Boumédienne continued this trend. However, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He [[collective farming|collectivised]] agriculture and launched a massive industrialisation drive. [[Extraction of petroleum|Oil extraction]] facilities were nationalised. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international [[1973 oil crisis]].

Boumédienne's successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of [[Arabisation]] in Algerian society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread conventional Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to Orthodox Islam.<ref name=""faco"" />

The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]].<ref name=""autogenerated1"">{{cite web|last=Prochaska|first=David|title=That Was Then, This Is Now: The Battle of Algiers and After.|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhr/summary/v085/85.1prochaska.html|page=141|access-date=10 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725163300/http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhr/summary/v085/85.1prochaska.html|archive-date=25 July 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system.

In December 1991 the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] dominated the first of two rounds of [[Algerian legislative election, 1991|legislative elections]]. Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections. Bendjedid resigned and a [[High Council of State (Algeria)|High Council of State]] was installed to act as the Presidency. It banned the FIS, triggering a civil [[insurgency]] between the Front's armed wing, the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 people are thought to have died. The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of [[List of massacres during the Algerian Civil War|civilian massacres]].<ref>""[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/30/world/98-die-in-one-of-algerian-civil-war-s-worst-massacres.html 98 Die in One of Algerian Civil War's Worst Massacres ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623134112/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/30/world/98-die-in-one-of-algerian-civil-war-s-worst-massacres.html |date=23 June 2017 }}"".

He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a ""Civil Concord"" initiative, approved in a [[Algerian Civil Concord referendum, 1999|referendum]], under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly. The [[Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat]] (GSPC), a splinter group of the Armed Islamic Group, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.<ref name=""faco"" />

Bouteflika was re-elected in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2004|April 2004 presidential election]] after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]], which was approved in a [[Algerian national reconciliation referendum, 2005|referendum in September 2005]]. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.<ref name=""faco"" />

In November 2008, the [[Algerian Constitution]] was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]], and he was re-elected in April 2009. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.<ref name=""faco"" />

Tebboune is accused to be close to the military and being loyal to the deposed president. Tebboune rejects these accusations, claiming to be the victim of a witch hunt.

Since the 2011 breakup of Sudan, and the creation of South Sudan, Algeria has been the largest country in Africa, and the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. Its southern part includes a significant portion of the [[Sahara]]. To the north, the [[Tell Atlas]] form with the [[Saharan Atlas]], further south, two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound, and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands. Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria. The vast mountain ranges of [[Aures]] and [[Tébessa|Nememcha]] occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border. The highest point is [[Mount Tahat]] ({{convert|3003|m|ft|disp=or}}).

Algeria lies mostly between latitudes [[19th parallel north|19°]] and [[37th parallel north|37°N]] (a small area is north of 37°N and south of 19°N), and longitudes [[9th meridian west|9°W]] and [[12th meridian east|12°E]]. Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural [[harbour]]s. The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile. South of the Tell Atlas is a [[steppe]] landscape ending with the [[Saharan Atlas]]; farther south, there is the Sahara desert.<ref name=LOC>{{cite web|last=Metz |first=Helen Chapin |author-link=Helen Chapin Metz |title=Algeria : a country study |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/dztoc.html |publisher=United States Library of Congress |access-date=18 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115052428/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/dztoc.html |archive-date=15 January 2013 }}</ref>

The [[Hoggar Mountains]] ({{lang-ar|جبال هقار}}), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria. They are located about {{convert|1500|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the capital, Algiers, and just east of [[Tamanghasset]].

In this region, midday desert temperatures can be hot year round. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.

Rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from {{convert|400|to|670|mm|1|abbr=on}} annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as {{convert|1000|mm|1|abbr=on}} in some years.

Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful. Algeria also has [[erg (landform)|ergs]], or sand dunes, between mountains. Among these, in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can go up to {{convert|110|°F|°C|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

[[File:Vulpes zerda.JPG|thumb|left|The [[fennec fox]] is the [[national animal]] of Algeria]]

The varied vegetation of Algeria includes [[coastal]], [[mountainous]] and grassy [[desert]]-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife. Many of the creatures comprising the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilisation. The most commonly seen animals include the wild [[boar]]s, [[jackal]]s, and [[gazelle]]s, although it is not uncommon to spot [[fennecs]] (foxes), and [[jerboas]]. Algeria also has a small [[African leopard]] and [[Saharan cheetah]] population, but these are seldom seen. A species of deer, the [[Barbary stag]], inhabits the dense humid forests in the north-eastern areas. The [[fennec fox]] is the [[national animal]] of Algeria.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hodges |first=K. |title=National Animals of African Countries |url=http://african.howzit.msn.com/national-animals-of-african-countries?page=10 |access-date=19 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225172955/http://african.howzit.msn.com/national-animals-of-african-countries?page=10 |archive-date=25 February 2014}}</ref>

A variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers. The forests are inhabited by boars and jackals. [[Barbary macaque]]s are the sole native monkey. Snakes, [[monitor lizard]]s, and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of [[rodent]]s throughout the [[semi arid]] regions of Algeria. Many animals are now extinct, including the [[Barbary lion]]s, [[Atlas bear]]s and [[West African crocodile|crocodile]]s.<ref>""[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0014734 Crocodiles in the Sahara Desert: An Update of Distribution, Habitats and Population Status for Conservation Planning in Mauritania] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810113430/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0014734 |date=10 August 2018 }}"".

In the north, some of the native flora includes [[Macchia]] scrub, [[Olive|olive trees]], [[oak]]s, [[cedrus|cedars]] and other [[Pinophyta|conifers]]. The mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens ([[Aleppo pine]], [[juniper]], and [[evergreen oak]]) and some deciduous trees. [[Ficus|Fig]], [[eucalyptus]], [[agave]], and various [[Arecaceae|palm trees]] grow in the warmer areas. The [[grape vine]] is indigenous to the coast. In the Sahara region, some oases have palm trees. [[Acacia]]s with wild [[olive]]s are the predominant flora in the remainder of the [[Sahara]]. Algeria had a 2018 [[Forest Landscape Integrity Index]] mean score of 5.22/10, ranking it 106th globally out of 172 countries.<ref name=""FLII-Supplementary"">{{cite journal|last1=Grantham|first1=H.

Algeria is included in the [[European Union|European Union's]] [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.
Giving incentives and rewarding best performers, as well as offering funds in a faster and more flexible manner, are the two main principles underlying the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) that came into force in 2014. It has a budget of €15.4 billion and provides the bulk of funding through a number of programmes.

In 2009, the French government agreed to compensate victims of nuclear tests in Algeria. Defence Minister Herve Morin stated that ""It's time for our country to be at peace with itself, at peace thanks to a system of compensation and reparations,"" when presenting the draft law on the payouts.

{{Main|Economy of Algeria}}
[[File:GDP per capita development in Algeria.png| upright=1.35|thumb|right|GDP per capita development in Algeria]]
Algeria's currency is the [[Algerian dinar|dinar]] (DZD). The economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy of the country's socialist post-independence development model. In recent years, the Algerian government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy.<ref name=""AlgeriaFactbook""/> These restrictions are just starting to be lifted off recently although questions about Algeria's slowly-diversifying economy remain.{{cn|date=November 2023}}

Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy. The government's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages.<ref name=""AlgeriaFactbook""/> The country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems, including the need to diversify the economy, strengthen political, economic and financial reforms, improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions.<ref name=aaeo/>

A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases. Public spending has increased by 27% annually during the past five years. The 2010–14 public-investment programme will cost US$286 billion, 40% of which will go to human development.<ref name=aaeo/>

Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $173 billion in [[foreign currency reserves]] and a large hydrocarbon stabilisation fund. In addition, Algeria's [[List of countries by external debt|external debt]] is extremely low at about 2% of GDP.<ref name=""AlgeriaFactbook""/> The economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth, and, despite high foreign exchange reserves (US$178 billion, equivalent to three years of imports), current expenditure growth makes Algeria's budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues.<ref name=imfart4/>

===Oil and natural resources===

[[File:Algeria pipelines map.jpg|thumb|left|Pipelines across Algeria]]

Algeria, whose economy is reliant on petroleum, has been an [[OPEC]] member since 1969. Its crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe.<ref name=opb15>{{cite web|title=OPEC Bulletin 8-9/12|url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/flipbook/OB08092012/OB08092012/assets/basic-html/page17.html|page=15|access-date=6 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224114739/http://www.opec.org/opec_web/flipbook/OB08092012/OB08092012/assets/basic-html/page17.html|archive-date=24 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and 87.7%<ref>{{Cite news|date=13 November 2021|title=Exportations hors hydrocarbures: une recette de près de 3 mds de dollars durant les huit 1ers mois de 2021|work=APS|url=https://www.aps.dz/economie/127366-exportations-hors-hydrocarbures-une-recette-de-pres-de-3-mds-de-dollars-durant-les-huit-1ers-mois-de-2021|access-date=30 January 2022}}</ref> of export earnings.

Non-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5%. To cope with social demands, the authorities raised expenditure, especially on basic food support, employment creation, support for SMEs, and higher salaries. High hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position.<ref name=imfart4/>

Income from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing high oil prices, though the trend in production volume is downwards.<ref name=aaeo/> Production from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume, continues to decline, dropping from 43.2 million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011.

===Research and alternative energy sources===
Algeria has invested an estimated 100 billion dinars towards developing research facilities and paying researchers. This development program is meant to advance alternative energy production, especially solar and wind power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portail.cder.dz/spip.php?article1571 |title=Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Algerian Program (English Version) |access-date=31 October 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101101749/http://portail.cder.dz/spip.php?article1571 |archive-date=1 November 2016 }}</ref> Algeria is estimated to have the largest solar energy potential in the Mediterranean, so the government has funded the creation of a solar science park in Hassi R'Mel. Currently, Algeria has 20,000 research professors at various universities and over 780 research labs, with state-set goals to expand to 1,000. Besides solar energy, areas of research in Algeria include space and satellite telecommunications, nuclear power and medical research.

===Labour market===
The overall rate of unemployment was 10% in 2011, but remained higher among young people, with a rate of 21.5% for those aged between 15 and 24. The government strengthened in 2011 the job programs introduced in 1988, in particular in the framework of the program to aid those seeking work (Dispositif d'Aide à l'Insertion Professionnelle).<ref name=""aaeo"" />

The development of the tourism sector in Algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of facilities, but since 2004 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting in many hotels of a high modern standard being built.

There are several [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] in Algeria<ref>{{cite web|last=UNESCO|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/dz|access-date=25 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919064425/https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/dz|archive-date=19 September 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> including [[Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad]], the first capital of the [[Hammadid]] empire; [[Tipasa]], a Phoenician and later Roman town; and [[Djémila]] and [[Timgad]], both [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ruins; [[M'Zab Valley]], a limestone valley containing a large urbanized [[oasis]]; and the [[Casbah]] of Algiers, an important citadel.

[[File:Autoroute est ouest ghomri2.JPG|thumb|The main highway connecting the Moroccan to the Tunisian border was a part of the [[Cairo–Dakar Highway]] project]]

The Algerian road network is the densest in Africa; its length is estimated at {{cvt|180,000|km}} of highways, with more than 3,756 structures and a paving rate of 85%. This network will be complemented by the [[Algeria East–West Highway|East-West Highway]], a major infrastructure project currently under construction. It is a 3-way, {{convert|1216|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} highway, linking [[Annaba]] in the extreme east to the [[Tlemcen]] in the far west. Algeria is also crossed by the [[Trans-Sahara Highway]], which is now completely paved.

===Health===
{{Main|Health in Algeria}}
In 2018, Algeria had the highest numbers of physicians in the Maghreb region (1.72 per 1,000 people), nurses (2.23 per 1,000 people), and dentists (0.31 per 1,000 people). Access to ""improved water sources"" was around 97.4% of the population in urban areas and 98.7% of the population in the rural areas. Some 99% of Algerians living in urban areas, and around 93.4% of those living in rural areas, had access to ""improved sanitation"". According to the World Bank, Algeria is making progress toward its goal of ""reducing by half the number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015"". Given Algeria's young population, policy favours preventive health care and clinics over hospitals. In keeping with this policy, the government maintains an immunisation program. However, poor sanitation and unclean water still cause [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]]. The poor generally receive health care free of charge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf |title=Library of Congress Country Studies – Algeria |access-date=20 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319155750/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf |archive-date=19 March 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Algeria has 26 universities and 67 institutions of higher education, which must accommodate a million Algerians and 80,000 foreign students in 2008. The [[University of Algiers]], founded in 1879, is the oldest, it offers education in various disciplines (law, medicine, science and letters). Twenty-five of these universities and almost all of the institutions of higher education were founded after the independence of the country.

Even if some of them offer instruction in [[Arabic]] like areas of law and the economy, most of the other sectors as science and medicine continue to be provided in French and English. Among the most important universities, there are the [[University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene]], the [[University of Mentouri]] Constantine, and [[University of Oran]] Es-Senia.

Modern Algerian literature, split between [[Classical Arabic|Arabic]], [[Berber languages|Tamazight]] and [[French Language|French]], has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history. [[List of Algerian writers|Famous novelists]] of the 20th century include [[Mohammed Dib]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Kateb Yacine]] and [[Ahlam Mosteghanemi]] while [[Assia Djebar]] is widely translated. Among the important novelists of the 1980s were [[Rachid Mimouni]], later vice-president of [[Amnesty International]], and [[Tahar Djaout]], murdered by an [[Islamist]] group in 1993 for his secularist views.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tahar Djaout |publisher=French Publishers' Agency |url=http://www.frenchpubagency.com/?fuseaction=people.main&pid=517 |access-date=17 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620082020/http://www.frenchpubagency.com/?fuseaction=people.main&pid=517 |archive-date=20 June 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Malek Bennabi]] and [[Frantz Fanon]] are noted for their thoughts on [[decolonization]]; [[Augustine of Hippo]] was born in [[Tagaste]] (modern-day [[Souk Ahras]]); and [[Ibn Khaldun]], though born in [[Tunis]], wrote the [[Muqaddima]] while staying in Algeria. The works of the [[Senussi|Sanusi]] family in pre-colonial times, and of [[Emir Abdelkader]] and Sheikh [[Abdelhamid Ben Badis|Ben Badis]] in colonial times, are widely noted. The Latin author [[Apuleius]] was born in [[Madaurus]] (Mdaourouch), in what later became Algeria.

Contemporary [[Algerian cinema]] is various in terms of genre, exploring a wider range of themes and issues. There has been a transition from cinema which focused on the war of independence to films more concerned with the everyday lives of Algerians.<ref>{{cite web |title=Short guide to contemporary Algerian cinema |publisher=Mapping Contemporary Cinema |url=http://www.mcc.sllf.qmul.ac.uk/?p=550 |access-date=1 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311032134/http://www.mcc.sllf.qmul.ac.uk/?p=550 |archive-date=11 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Algerian painters, like [[Mohammed Racim]] and [[Baya (artist)|Baya]], attempted to revive the prestigious Algerian past prior to French colonisation, at the same time that they have contributed to the preservation of the authentic values of Algeria. In this line, [[Mohamed Temam]], [[Abdelkhader Houamel]] have also returned through this art, scenes from the history of the country, the habits and customs of the past and the country life. Other new artistic currents including the one of [[M'hamed Issiakhem]], [[Mohammed Khadda]] and [[Bachir Yelles]], appeared on the scene of Algerian painting, abandoning figurative classical painting to find new pictorial ways, in order to adapt Algerian paintings to the new realities of the country through its struggle and its aspirations.

The historic roots of Algerian literature go back to the [[Numidia]]n and [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]]n era, when [[Apuleius]] wrote ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', the only Latin novel to survive in its entirety. This period had also known [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Nonius Marcellus]] and [[Martianus Capella]], among many others. The Middle Ages have known many Arabic writers who revolutionised the Arab world literature, with authors like [[Ahmad al-Buni]], [[Ibn Manzur]] and [[Ibn Khaldoun]], who wrote the [[Muqaddimah]] while staying in Algeria, and many others.

[[Albert Camus]] was an Algerian-born French Pied-Noir author. In 1957, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in literature]].

Today Algeria contains, in its literary landscape, big names having not only marked the Algerian literature, but also the universal literary heritage in Arabic and French.

As a first step, Algerian literature was marked by works whose main concern was the assertion of the Algerian national entity, there is the publication of novels as the ''Algerian trilogy'' of [[Mohammed Dib]], or even ''Nedjma'' of [[Kateb Yacine]] novel which is often regarded as a monumental and major work. Other known writers will contribute to the emergence of Algerian literature whom include [[Mouloud Feraoun]], [[Malek Bennabi]], [[Malek Haddad]], [[Moufdi Zakaria]], Abdelhamid Ben Badis, Mohamed Laïd Al-Khalifa, [[Mouloud Mammeri]], [[Frantz Fanon]], and [[Assia Djebar]].

In the aftermath of the independence, several new authors emerged on the Algerian literary scene, they will attempt through their works to expose a number of social problems, among them there are [[Rachid Boudjedra]], [[Rachid Mimouni]], [[Leila Sebbar]], [[Tahar Djaout]] and [[Tahir Wattar]].

Currently, a part of Algerian writers tends to be defined in a literature of shocking expression, due to the terrorism that occurred during the 1990s, the other party is defined in a different style of literature who staged an individualistic conception of the human adventure. Among the most noted recent works, there is the writer, ''the swallows of Kabul'' and ''the attack'' of [[Yasmina Khadra]], ''the oath of barbarians'' of [[Boualem Sansal]], ''memory of the flesh'' of [[Ahlam Mosteghanemi]] and the last novel by Assia Djebar ''nowhere in my father's House''.

The Algerian state's interest in film-industry activities can be seen in the annual budget of DZD 200 million (EUR 1.3 million) allocated to production, specific measures and an ambitious programme plan implemented by the Ministry of Culture in order to promote national production, renovate the cinema stock and remedy the weak links in distribution and exploitation.

The financial support provided by the state, through the Fund for the Development of the Arts, Techniques and the Film Industry (FDATIC) and the Algerian Agency for Cultural Influence (AARC), plays a key role in the promotion of national production. Between 2007 and 2013, FDATIC subsidised 98 films (feature films, documentaries and short films). In mid-2013, AARC had already supported a total of 78 films, including 42 feature films, 6 short films and 30 documentaries.

According to the European Audiovisual Observatory's LUMIERE database, 41 Algerian films were distributed in Europe between 1996 and 2013; 21 films in this repertoire were Algerian-French co-productions. [[Days of Glory (2006 film)|''Days of Glory'' (2006)]] and [[Outside the Law (2010 film)|''Outside the Law'' (2010)]] recorded the highest number of admissions in the European Union, 3,172,612 and 474,722, respectively.<ref>Ali, Sahar (25 March 2014) [http://www.obs.coe.int/documents/205595/412951/Rapport_Alg%C3%A9rie_FR_21-05-2014.pdf ALGÉRIE] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203213653/http://www.obs.coe.int/documents/205595/412951/Rapport_Alg%C3%A9rie_FR_21-05-2014.pdf |date=3 February 2016 }}.

'''Angola''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-Angola-pronunciation.ogg|æ|n|ˈ|ɡ|oʊ|l|ə}} {{respell|an|GOH|lə}}; {{IPA|pt|ɐ̃ˈɡɔlɐ|lang}}; {{lang-kg|Ngola}}, {{IPA|kg|ŋɔla|pron}}), officially the '''Republic of Angola''' ({{lang-pt|República de Angola}}), is a country on the west-[[Central Africa|central]] coast of [[Southern Africa]]. It is the second-largest [[Lusophone]] ([[List of territorial entities where Portuguese is an official language|Portuguese-speaking]]) country in both total area and [[List of countries and dependencies by population|population]] (behind [[Brazil]] in both cases), and is the [[List of African countries by area|seventh-largest]] country in [[Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Namibia]] to the south, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north, [[Zambia]] to the east, and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. Angola has an [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] province, the province of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]], that borders the [[Republic of the Congo]] and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The capital and most populous city is [[Luanda]].

Angola has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic Age]]. Its formation as a nation-state originates from [[European exploration of Africa|Portuguese colonisation]], which initially began with coastal settlements and [[trading post]]s founded in the 16th century. In the 19th century, European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior. The [[Portuguese Angola|Portuguese colony]] that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century, owing to resistance by native groups such as the Cuamato, the [[Oukwanyama|Kwanyama]] and the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]].

After a protracted [[Angolan War of Independence|anti-colonial struggle]], Angola achieved independence in 1975 as a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] [[People's Republic of Angola|one-party Republic]]. The country descended into a devastating [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] the same year, between the ruling [[MPLA|People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA), backed by the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]], the insurgent [[UNITA|National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]], an originally [[Maoism|Maoist]] and later anti-communist group supported by the [[United States]] and [[South Africa]], and the militant organization [[National Liberation Front of Angola]], backed by [[Zaire]]. The country has been governed by MPLA ever since its independence in 1975. Following the end of the war in 2002, Angola emerged as a relatively stable [[Unitary state|unitary]], [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[constitutional republic]].

Angola has vast [[Mineral resource estimation|mineral]] and [[Oil reserves|petroleum reserves]], and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world, especially since the end of the civil war; however, economic growth is highly uneven, with most of the nation's [[Distribution of wealth#Wealth concentration|wealth concentrated]] in a disproportionately small part of the population; the largest investment and trade partners are [[China]] and the United States.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite journal|date=13 April 2010|title=Transparency and Accountability in Angola|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/04/13/transparency-and-accountability-angola|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006051053/http://www.hrw.org/report/2010/04/13/transparency-and-accountability-angola|archive-date=6 October 2015|access-date=1 April 2016|website=Human Rights Watch}}</ref> The [[standard of living]] remains low for most Angolans; [[life expectancy]] is among the [[List of countries by life expectancy|lowest in the world]], while [[infant mortality]] is [[List of countries by infant and under-five mortality rates|among the highest]].<ref name="":2"">{{cite web|title=Life expectancy at birth|year=2014|work=World Fact Book|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|access-date=4 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120024054/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|archive-date=20 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since 2017, the government of [[João Lourenço]] has made fighting corruption its flagship, so much so that many individuals of the previous government are either jailed or awaiting trial.

Angola is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[African Union]], the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], and the [[Southern African Development Community]]. {{As of|2021}}, the Angolan population is estimated at 32.87 million. Angola is multicultural and multiethnic. [[Angolan culture]] reflects centuries of Portuguese influence, namely the predominance of the [[Portuguese language]] and of the [[Catholic Church]], intermingled with a variety of indigenous customs and traditions.

==Etymology==
The name ''Angola'' comes from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] colonial name {{lang|pt|[[Portuguese Angola|Reino de Angola]]}} ('Kingdom of Angola'), which appeared as early as [[Paulo Dias de Novais]]'s 1571 charter.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Heywood |first1=Linda M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S42CypbRTlQC&pg=PA82 |title=Central Africans, Atlantic Creoles, and the Foundation of the Americas, 1585-1660 |last2=Thornton |first2=John K. |date=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521770651 |page=82 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320074507/http://books.google.com/books?id=S42CypbRTlQC&pg=PA82 |archive-date=20 March 2015}}</ref> The [[Toponymy|toponym]] was derived by the Portuguese from the title {{lang|kmb|[[List of Ngolas of Ndongo|ngola]]}} held by the kings of [[Kingdom of Ndongo|Ndongo and Matamba]].

===Early migrations and political units===
[[File:Jean_Roy_de_Congo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[João I of Kongo|King João I]], [[Manikongo]] of the [[Kingdom of Kongo]]]]
Modern Angola was populated predominantly by [[nomad]]ic [[Khoi]] and [[San people|San]] prior to the first [[Bantu migration]]s. The Khoi and San peoples were neither [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]]s nor cultivators, but rather [[hunter-gatherer]]s.<ref name=Henderson>{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=Lawrence|title=Angola: Five Centuries of Conflict|date=1979|pages=40–42|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=978-0812216202}}</ref> They were displaced by [[Bantu peoples]] arriving from the north in the first millennium BC, most of whom likely originated in what is today northwestern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Niger]].<ref name=Miller1>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Joseph|title=Kings and Kinsmen: Early Mbundu States in Angola|date=1979|pages=55–56|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=978-0198227045}}</ref> Bantu speakers introduced the cultivation of [[banana]]s and [[taro]], as well as large cattle herds, to Angola's central highlands and the Luanda plain. Due to a number of inhibiting geographic factors throughout the landscape of Angola, namely harshly traversable land, hot/humid climate, and a plethora of deadly diseases, intermingling of pre-colonial tribes in Angola was rare.

A number of political entities were established; the best-known of these was the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], based in Angola, which extended northward to what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo and [[Gabon]]. It established [[trade route]]s with other city-states and civilisations up and down the coast of southwestern and western Africa and even with [[Great Zimbabwe]] and the [[Mutapa Empire]], although it engaged in little or no transoceanic trade.<ref name=""The Story of Africa"">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page45.shtml|title=The Story of Africa|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=27 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524040820/http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page45.shtml|archive-date=24 May 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> To its south lay the [[Kingdom of Ndongo]], from which the area of the later Portuguese colony was sometimes known as ''Dongo'', and right next to them lay the [[Kingdom of Matamba]].<ref name=EB1878>{{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Angola |volume=2 |page=45 }}</ref>

[[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Age of Discovery|explorer]] [[Diogo Cão]] reached the area in 1484.<ref name=EB1878/> The previous year, the Portuguese had established relations with the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]], which stretched at the time from modern [[Gabon]] in the north to the [[Kwanza River]] in the south. The Portuguese established their primary early trading post at [[Soyo]], which is now the northernmost city in Angola apart from the [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] [[enclave and exclave|exclave]]. [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded São Paulo de Loanda ([[Luanda]]) in 1575 with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers. [[Benguela]] was fortified in 1587 and became a township in 1617.

The Portuguese established several other settlements, forts and trading posts along the Angolan coast, principally trading in [[Slavery in Angola|Angolan slaves]] for [[plantations in the American South|plantations]].

Despite Portugal's territorial claims in Angola, its control over much of the country's vast interior was minimal.<ref name=EB1878/> In the 16th century Portugal gained control of the coast through a series of treaties and wars. Life for European colonists was difficult and progress was slow. [[John Iliffe (historian)|John Iliffe]] notes that ""Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great [[famine]] occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys"".<ref>Iliffe, John (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC ''Africans: the history of a continent''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610211914/https://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC |date=10 June 2016 }}.

During the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], the [[Dutch West India Company]] [[Dutch Loango-Angola|occupied]] the principal settlement of Luanda in 1641, using alliances with local peoples to carry out attacks against Portuguese holdings elsewhere.<ref name=""Handbook""/> A fleet under [[Salvador de Sá]] retook Luanda in 1648; reconquest of the rest of the territory was completed by 1650. New treaties with the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]] were signed in 1649; others with [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Njinga]]'s Kingdom of [[Matamba]] and [[Ndongo]] followed in 1656. The conquest of [[Pungo Andongo]] in 1671 was the last major Portuguese expansion from Luanda, as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed. Colonial outposts also expanded inward from Benguela, but until the late 19th century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited.<ref name=EB1878/> Hamstrung by a series of political upheavals in the early 1800s, Portugal was slow to mount a large scale annexation of Angolan territory.<ref name=""Handbook""/>

Ever since the British parliament had adopted the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]], His Majesty’s Government had taken the battle for abolition to the slave-trading nations of Europe and America and used the British Navy to help stop it. In 1817 and 1818, the British government scored a significant gain in its fight for the abolition of the international slave trade. In the span of a year, three European powers, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain agreed to a treaty which restricted the slave trade on the Atlantic and imposed an enforcement mechanism. The first of these treaties was that of London of 28 July 1817 with Portugal (67 CTS 373).

The [[slave trade]] was abolished in Angola in 1836, and in 1854 the colonial government freed all its existing slaves.<ref name=""Handbook""/> Four years later, a more progressive administration appointed by Portugal abolished [[slavery]] altogether. However, these decrees remained largely unenforceable, and the Portuguese depended on assistance from the British [[Royal Navy]] and what became known as the [[Blockade of Africa]] to enforce their ban on the slave trade.<ref name=""Handbook""/> This coincided with a series of renewed military expeditions into the bush.

By the mid-nineteenth century Portugal had established its dominion as far north as the [[Congo River]] and as far south as [[Moçâmedes|Mossâmedes]].<ref name=""Handbook""/> Until the late 1880s, Portugal entertained proposals to link Angola with its [[colony]] in [[Mozambique]] but was blocked by British and Belgian opposition.<ref name=Corrado>{{cite book|last=Corrado|first=Jacopo|title=The Creole Elite and the Rise of Angolan Protonationalism: 1870–1920|date=2008|pages=11–13|publisher=Cambria Press|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=978-1604975291}}</ref> In this period, the Portuguese came up against different forms of armed resistance from various peoples in Angola.<ref>See René Pélissier, ''Les guerres grises: Résistance et revoltes en Angola, (1845-1941)'', Éditions Pélissier, Montamets, 78630 Orgeval (France), 1977</ref>

Between 1939 and 1943 the Portuguese army carried out operations against the nomadic [[Mucubal people]], accused of rebellion, which led to the death of half their population. The survivors were incarcerated in concentration camps, sent to forced labor camps, where the great majority of them perished due to the brutality of the work system, undernourishment and executions.<ref>Rafael Coca de Campos ''Kakombola.

A largely [[Ovimbundu]] guerrilla initiative against the Portuguese in central Angola from 1966 was spearheaded by [[Jonas Savimbi]] and the ''[[UNITA|National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]]'' (UNITA).<ref name=""Hanlon""/> It remained handicapped by its geographic remoteness from friendly borders, the ethnic fragmentation of the Ovimbundu, and the isolation of peasants on European plantations where they had little opportunity to mobilise.<ref name=""Chabal""/>

During the late 1950s, the rise of the Marxist–Leninist ''[[MPLA|Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]]'' (MPLA) in the east and Dembos hills north of Luanda came to hold special significance. Formed as a coalition resistance movement by the [[Angolan Communist Party]],<ref name=""Cornwell""/> the organisation's leadership remained predominantly [[Ambundu]] and courted public sector workers in [[Luanda]].<ref name=""Hanlon""/> Although both the MPLA and its rivals accepted material assistance from the [[Soviet Union]] or the [[People's Republic of China]], the former harboured strong anti-imperialist views and was openly critical of the [[United States]] and its support for Portugal.<ref name=""Stockwell""/> This allowed it to win important ground on the diplomatic front, soliciting support from nonaligned governments in [[Morocco]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], and the [[United Arab Republic]].<ref name=""Cornwell""/>

The MPLA attempted to move its headquarters from [[Conakry]] to Léopoldville in October 1961, renewing efforts to create a common front with the FNLA, then known as the ''Union of Angolan Peoples'' (UPA) and its leader [[Holden Roberto]]. Roberto turned down the offer.<ref name=""Cornwell""/> When the MPLA first attempted to insert its own insurgents into Angola, the cadres were ambushed and annihilated by UPA partisans on Roberto's orders—setting a precedent for the bitter factional strife which would later ignite the [[Angolan Civil War]].<ref name=""Cornwell""/>

===Exclave of Cabinda===
{{Main|Cabinda Province}}
[[File:Governo Provincial do Namibe (19543179475) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Namibe Province|Provincial Government of Namibe]].]]
With an area of approximately {{convert|7283|km2|sqmi}}, the Northern Angolan province of Cabinda is unusual in being separated from the rest of the country by a strip, some {{convert|60|km}} wide, of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] along the lower [[Congo River]]. Cabinda borders the [[Congo Republic]] to the north and north-northeast and the DRC to the east and south. The town of Cabinda is the chief population centre.

According to a 1995 census, Cabinda had an estimated population of 600,000, approximately 400,000 of whom are citizens of neighboring countries. Population estimates are, however, highly unreliable. Consisting largely of tropical forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber and palm oil.

The product for which it is best known, however, is its oil, which has given it the nickname, ""the Kuwait of Africa"". Cabinda's petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of Angola's output.<ref>{{cite news|date=22 December 2013|title=Angola profile|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13036732|url-status=live|access-date=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624084435/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13036732|archive-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> Most of the oil along its coast was discovered under [[Portuguese Angola|Portuguese rule]] by the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (CABGOC) from 1968 onwards.

Ever since [[Portugal]] handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of Angola to the local independence groups (MPLA, UNITA and FNLA), the territory of Cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the [[Government of Angola]] (which has employed its armed forces, the FAA—Forças Armadas Angolanas) and Cabindan separatists.

===Constitution===

{{main|Constitution of Angola}}
The [[Constitution of Angola|Constitution of 2010]] establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system is based on Portuguese law and customary law but is weak and fragmented, and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Angola|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/angola/19488.htm|website=State.gov|publisher=US Department of State|access-date=22 November 2016|archive-date=10 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200210081539/https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/angola/19488.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court does not hold the powers of [[judicial review]].<ref name=""CIA""/> Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by the president. After the end of the civil war, the regime came under pressure from within as well as from the international community to become more democratic and less authoritarian. Its reaction was to implement a number of changes without substantially changing its character.<ref>Péclard, Didier (ed.) (2008) ''L'Angola dans la paix: Autoritarisme et reconversions'', special issue of ''Politique africains'' (Paris), p. 110.</ref>

The [[Constitution of Angola|new constitution]], adopted in 2010, did away with presidential elections, introducing a system in which the president and the vice-president of the political party that wins the parliamentary elections automatically become president and vice-president. Directly or indirectly, the president controls all other organs of the state, so there is ''de facto'' no [[separation of powers]].<ref>Miranda, Jorge (2010) ""A Constituição de Angola de 2010"", ''O Direito'' (Lisbon), vol. 142.</ref> In the classifications used in constitutional law, this government falls under the category of ''authoritarian regime.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Angola Party Politics: Into the African Trend|last=Amundsen|first=Inge|publisher=Chr.

The Angolan Armed Forces (Forças Armadas Angolanas, FAA) are headed by a Chief of Staff who reports to the Minister of Defence. There are three divisions—the Army (Exército), Navy (Marinha de Guerra, MGA) and [[National Air Force of Angola|National Air Force]] (Força Aérea Nacional, FAN). Total manpower is 107,000; plus paramilitary forces of 10,000 (2015 est.).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia with Atlas and Weather guide|publisher=Helicon|year=2018|isbn=978-1-84972-716-7|location=Abington, UK}}</ref>

Its equipment includes Russian-manufactured fighters, bombers and transport planes. There are also Brazilian-made [[EMB-312 Tucano]]s for training, Czech-made L-39s for training and bombing, and a variety of western-made aircraft such as the C-212\Aviocar, Sud Aviation Alouette III, etc. A small number of FAA personnel are stationed in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Kinshasa) and 500 more were deployed in March 2023 due to the resurgence of the [[M23 rebellion|M23]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=AfricaNews |date=2020-07-06 |title=DRC: Angolan soldier killed in Kasai |url=https://www.africanews.com/2020/07/06/drc-angolan-soldier-killed-in-kasai/ |access-date=2022-05-10 |website=Africanews |language=en |archive-date=10 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220510124820/https://www.africanews.com/2020/07/06/drc-angolan-soldier-killed-in-kasai/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Gomes |first=Miguel |last2=Rolley |first2=Sonia |date=17 March 2023 |title=Angola to deploy troops in Congo's rebel-hit east |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/angola-deploy-troops-congos-rebel-hit-east-2023-03-17/ |access-date=15 April 2023}}</ref> The FAA has also participated in the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC)'s [[Southern African Development Community Mission in Mozambique|mission for peace]] in [[Cabo Delgado Province|Cabo Delgado]], [[Mozambique]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Angola to join SADC military mission to Mozambique - Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2021-07/28/c_1310092087.htm |access-date=2022-05-10 |website=www.xinhuanet.com |archive-date=25 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211025093503/http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2021-07/28/c_1310092087.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Police===
{{Main|Law enforcement in Angola}}
[[File:Angola transito (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Angolan National Police officers.]]
The National Police departments are Public Order, Criminal Investigation, Traffic and Transport, Investigation and Inspection of Economic Activities, Taxation and Frontier Supervision, Riot Police and the Rapid Intervention Police. The National Police are in the process of standing up an air wing,{{when|date=November 2017}} to provide helicopter support for operations. The National Police are developing their criminal investigation and forensic capabilities. The force has an estimated 6,000 patrol officers, 2,500 taxation and frontier supervision officers, 182 criminal investigators and 100 financial crimes detectives and around 90 economic activity inspectors.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The National Police have implemented a modernisation and development plan to increase the capabilities and efficiency of the total force. In addition to administrative reorganisation, modernisation projects include procurement of new vehicles, aircraft and equipment, construction of new police stations and forensic laboratories, restructured training programmes and the replacement of [[AKM rifle]]s with 9&nbsp;mm [[Uzi]]s for officers in urban areas.

===Justice===
A Supreme Court serves as a court of appeal. The Constitutional Court is the supreme body of the constitutional jurisdiction, established with the approval of Law no. 2/08, of 17 June – Organic Law of the Constitutional Court and Law n. 3/08, of 17 June – Organic Law of the Constitutional Process. The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary law. There are 12 courts in more than 140 counties in the country. Its first task was the validation of the candidacies of the political parties to the legislative elections of 5 September 2008. Thus, on 25 June 2008, the Constitutional Court was institutionalized and its Judicial Counselors assumed the position before the President of the Republic. Currently, seven advisory judges are present, four men and three women. {{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

In 2014, a new penal code took effect in Angola.

The enormous differences between the regions pose a serious structural problem for the Angolan economy, illustrated by the fact that about one third of economic activities are concentrated in Luanda and neighbouring Bengo province, while several areas of the interior suffer economic stagnation and even regression.<ref>Manuel Alves da Rocha (2010) [http://www.ceic-ucan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/desigualdades-e-assimetrias-regionais-em-angola.pdf ''Desigualdades e assimetrias regionais em Angola: Os factores da competitividade territorial''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318160716/http://www.ceic-ucan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/desigualdades-e-assimetrias-regionais-em-angola.pdf |date=18 March 2015 }}, Luanda: Centro de Estudos e Investigação Científica da Universidade Católica de Angola.</ref>

One of the economic consequences of social and regional disparities is a sharp increase in Angolan private investments abroad. The small fringe of Angolan society where most of the asset accumulation takes place seeks to spread its assets, for reasons of security and profit. For the time being, the biggest share of these investments is concentrated in Portugal where the [[Angolans in Portugal|Angolan presence]] (including the family of the state president) in banks as well as in the domains of energy, [[Telecommunications in Angola|telecommunications]], and [[mass media]] has become notable, as has the acquisition of vineyards and orchards as well as of tourism enterprises.<ref>""A força do kwanza"", ''Visão'' (Lisbon), 993, 15 May 2012, pp. 50–54</ref>

Agriculture and forestry is an area of potential opportunity for the country. The African Economic Outlook organization states that ""Angola requires 4.5 million tonnes a year of grain but grows only about 55% of the [[maize]] it needs, 20% of the [[rice]] and just 5% of its required [[wheat]]"".<ref>

In addition, the World Bank estimates that ""less than 3 per cent of Angola's abundant fertile land is cultivated and the economic potential of the forestry sector remains largely unexploited"".<ref>""Country partnership strategy for the Republic of Angola"" (15 August 2013). World Bank (Report No. 76225-A0)</ref>

Before independence in 1975, [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] was a bread-basket of southern Africa and a major exporter of [[banana]]s, coffee and [[sisal]], but [[Angolan Civil War|three decades of civil war]] (1975–2002) destroyed fertile countryside, left it littered with [[landmine]]s and drove millions into the cities.

The country now depends on expensive food imports, mainly from South Africa and [[Portugal]], while more than 90% of farming is done at the family and subsistence level. Thousands of Angolan small-scale farmers are trapped in poverty.<ref>Redvers, Louise [http://ipsnews.net/africa/nota.asp?idnews=47123 POVERTY-ANGOLA: Inter Press Service News Agency – NGOs Sceptical of Govt's Rural Development Plans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512215958/http://ipsnews.net/africa/nota.asp?idnews=47123|date=12 May 2010}}.</ref>

Transport in Angola consists of:
*Three separate [[Rail transport in Angola|railway systems]] totalling {{convert|2761|km|mi|abbr=on}}
*{{convert|76626|km|0|abbr=on}} of highway of which {{convert|19156|km|0|abbr=on}} is paved
*1,295 navigable inland waterways

*243 [[List of airports in Angola|airports]], of which 32 are paved.

Angola centers its port trade in five main ports: [[Port of Namibe|Namibe]], [[Port of Lobito|Lobito]], [[Soyo]], [[Cabinda (city)|Cabinda]] and Luanda. The [[port of Luanda]] is the largest of the five, as well as being one of the busiest on the African continent.<ref name=""africanbusinesscentral.com"">{{Cite web|url=https://www.africanbusinesscentral.com/2015/06/20/the-top-eight-busiest-ports-in-africa-photos-and-infographic/|title=The top eight busiest ports in Africa (Photos and Infographic)|website=African Business Central|access-date=4 February 2020|archive-date=4 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204061717/https://www.africanbusinesscentral.com/2015/06/20/the-top-eight-busiest-ports-in-africa-photos-and-infographic/|url-status=dead}}</ref>[[File:Catumbela River Bridge (19478241049).jpg|thumb|left|[[Catumbela]] Bridge in [[Benguela Province|Benguela]].]]
Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is{{When|date=February 2022}} often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles. While reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt. In many areas drivers have established alternative tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road. The [[Angolan government]] has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads. The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union,<ref>ec.europa.eu: [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_92_314 1992] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210526205205/https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_92_314 |date=26 May 2021 }}</ref> and is comparable to many European main routes.

In Luanda and region there subsists a nucleus of the ""[[syncretic]]"" [[Tocoists]] and in the north-west a sprinkling of [[Kimbanguism]] can be found, spreading from the Congo/Zaïre. Since independence, hundreds of [[Pentecostal]] and similar communities have sprung up in the cities, whereby now about 50% of the population is living; several of these communities/churches are of Brazilian origin.

Foreign [[Missionary|missionaries]] were very active prior to independence in 1975, although since the beginning of the anti-colonial fight in 1961 the Portuguese colonial authorities expelled a series of Protestant missionaries and closed mission stations based on the belief that the missionaries were inciting pro-independence sentiments. Missionaries have been able to return to the country since the early 1990s, although security conditions due to the civil war have prevented them until 2002 from restoring many of their former inland mission stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2001/5511.htm|title=International Religious Freedom Report – Angola|publisher=U.S. Department of State|date=1 January 2004|access-date=27 June 2010|archive-date=31 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131002030/https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2001/5511.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Angolan culture has been heavily influenced by [[Portuguese culture]], especially in language and religion, and the culture of the indigenous ethnic groups of Angola, predominantly [[Bantu people|Bantu culture]].

The diverse ethnic communities—the [[Ovimbundu]], [[Northern Mbundu people|Ambundu]], [[Bakongo]], [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]], [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]] and other peoples—to varying degrees maintain their own cultural traits, traditions and languages, but in the cities, where slightly more than half of the population now lives, a mixed culture has been emerging since colonial times; in [[Luanda]], since its foundation in the 16th century.

In this urban culture, Portuguese heritage has become more and more dominant. African roots are evident in music and dance and is moulding the way in which Portuguese is spoken. This process is well reflected in contemporary Angolan literature, especially in the works of [[Angolan literature|Angolan authors]].

In 2014, Angola resumed the National Festival of Angolan Culture after a 25-year break. The festival took place in all the provincial capitals and lasted for 20 days, with the theme ""Culture as a Factor of Peace and Development.<ref>[http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/lazer-e-cultura/2014/11/51/Retrospect2014-Fenacult-marks-cultural-year,58a0fcae-b594-4edd-bc8b-1d7e2e798f14.html Retrospect2014: Fenacult marks cultural year] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231184839/http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/lazer-e-cultura/2014/11/51/Retrospect2014-Fenacult-marks-cultural-year,58a0fcae-b594-4edd-bc8b-1d7e2e798f14.html |date=31 December 2014 }} Angola Press Agency, 18 December 2014</ref>

From the 17th to the 19th century, political entities in the area included the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], the city-state of Porto-Novo, and other states to the north. This region was referred to as the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]] from the early 17th century due to the high number of people who were sold and trafficked during the [[Atlantic slave trade]] to the New World. [[France]] took over the territory in 1894, incorporating it into [[French West Africa]] as [[French Dahomey]]. In 1960, Dahomey gained full independence from France. As a [[sovereign state]], Benin has had [[democratic governments]], [[Coup d'état|military coups]], and [[Military government|military governments]]. A self-described [[Marxist–Leninist state]] called the [[People's Republic of Benin]] existed between 1975 and 1990. In 1991, it was replaced by the [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] Republic of Benin.<ref name=""Ibp Usa p85"">{{cite book |title=Global Logistics Assessments Reports Handbook |volume=1: Strategic Transportation and Customs Information for Selected Countries |publisher=International Business Publications USA |date=2008 |orig-date=2015-10-06 |isbn=978-0739766033 |page=85}}</ref>

Prior to 1600, present-day Benin comprised a variety of areas with different political systems and ethnicities. These included [[City-state|city-states]] along the coast (primarily of the [[Aja people|Aja]] ethnic group, and also including [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Gbe languages|Gbe]] peoples) and tribal regions inland (composed of [[Bariba people|Bariba]], Mahi, Gedevi, and Kabye peoples). The [[Oyo Empire]], located primarily to the east of Benin, was a military force in the region, conducting raids and exacting tribute from the coastal kingdoms and tribal regions.<ref name=""Bay-1998"">{{cite book|last=Bay|first=Edna|title=Wives of the Leopard: Gender, Politics, and Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey|year=1998|publisher=University of Virginia Press}}</ref> The situation changed in the 17th and 18th centuries as the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], consisting mostly of [[Fon people]], was founded on the [[Abomey]] plateau and began taking over areas along the coast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Akinjogbin|first=I.A.|title=Dahomey and Its Neighbors: 1708–1818|year=1967|publisher=Cambridge University Press|oclc=469476592}}</ref> By 1727, King [[Agaja]] of the Kingdom of Dahomey had conquered the coastal cities of [[Allada]] and [[Ouidah|Whydah]].

[[File:Bénin- 1893.jpg|thumb|A French depiction of the conquest of Dahomey in 1893]]
By the middle of the 19th century, Dahomey had ""begun to weaken and lose its status as the regional power"". The French took over the area in 1892. In 1899, the French included the land called [[French Dahomey]] within the larger [[French West Africa]] colonial region.

France sought to benefit from Dahomey and the region ""appeared to lack the necessary agricultural or mineral resources for large-scale capitalist development"". As a result, France treated Dahomey as a sort of preserve in case future discoveries revealed resources worth developing.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Manning|first=Patrick|title=Slavery, Colonialism and Economic Growth in Dahomey, 1640-1960|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1982|isbn=9780511563072|pages=15}}</ref>

The French government outlawed the capture and sale of slaves. Previous slaveowners sought to redefine their control over slaves as control over land, tenants, and lineage members. This provoked a struggle among Dahomeans, ""concentrated in the period from 1895 to 1920, for the redistribution of control over land and labor. Villages sought to redefine boundaries of lands and fishing preserves. Religious disputes scarcely veiled the factional struggles over control of land and commerce which underlay them. Factions struggled for the leadership of great families"".<ref name="":1"" />

After 1960, there were coups and regime changes, with the figures of [[Hubert Maga]], [[Sourou Migan Apithy|Sourou Apithy]], [[Justin Ahomadégbé]], and [[Émile Derlin Zinsou]] dominating; the first 3 each represented a different area and ethnicity of the country. These 3 agreed to form a [[Presidential Council (Benin)|Presidential Council]] after violence marred the 1970 elections.

On 7 May 1972, Maga ceded power to Ahomadégbé. On 26 October 1972, Lt. Col. [[Mathieu Kérékou]] overthrew the ruling triumvirate, becoming president and stating that the country would not ""burden itself by copying foreign [[ideology]], and wants neither Capitalism, Communism, nor Socialism"". On 30 November 1974, he announced that the country was officially [[Marxism|Marxist]], under control of the Military Council of the Revolution (CMR), which nationalized the petroleum industry and banks. On 30 November 1975, he renamed the country the [[People's Republic of Benin]].<ref name=""Dickovick2012"">{{cite book|last=Dickovick |first= J.

In 1974, under the influence of young revolutionaries – the ""Ligueurs"" - the government embarked on a socialist program: nationalization of strategic sectors of the economy, reform of the education system, establishment of agricultural cooperatives and new local government structures, and a campaign to eradicate ""[[Feudalism|feudal]] forces"" including [[tribalism]]. The regime banned opposition activities. Mathieu Kérékou was elected president by the National Revolutionary Assembly in 1980, re-elected in 1984.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Benin}}<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->
Its politics take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] in which the [[President of Benin]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], within a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the government and the legislature. The [[judiciary]] is officially independent of the executive and the legislature, while in practice its independence has been gradually hollowed out by Talon, and the Constitutional Court is headed by his former personal lawyer.<ref name=""economist2021"">{{cite news |title=Benin's democratic beacon dims |url=https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/04/10/benins-democratic-beacon-dims |access-date=12 April 2021 |magazine=[[The Economist]] |archive-date=12 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210412022220/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/04/10/benins-democratic-beacon-dims |url-status=live }}</ref> The political system is derived from the 1990 [[Constitution of Benin]] and the subsequent transition to [[democracy]] in 1991.

Its democratic system ""has eroded"" since President Talon took office.<ref name=""economist2021"" /> In 2018 his government introduced new rules for fielding candidates and raised the cost of registering. The electoral commission, packed with Talon's allies, barred all opposition parties from the parliamentary election in 2019, resulting in a parliament made up entirely of supporters of Talon. That parliament subsequently changed election laws such that presidential candidates need to have the approval of at least 10% of Benin's MPs and mayors. As parliament and most mayors' offices are controlled by Talon, he has control over who can run for president. These changes have drawn condemnation from international observers and led to the United States government partially terminating development assistance to the country.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Benin: Freedom in the World 2021 Country Report|url=https://freedomhouse.org/country/benin/freedom-world/2021|access-date=2021-12-16|website=Freedom House|language=en|archive-date=16 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211216181132/https://freedomhouse.org/country/benin/freedom-world/2021|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Press Release: MCC's Board Selects Belize, Zambia for Grant Assistance|url=https://www.mcc.gov/news-and-events/release/press-release-121521-board-selects-belize-zambia|url-status=live|access-date=2021-12-16|website=Millennium Challenge Corporation|language=en|quote=However, due to Benin's overall multi-year decline in its commitment to MCC's eligibility criteria and the principles of democratic governance, the Board discussed and endorsed MCC's determination to significantly reduce the portion of the planned regional investment that would be made in Benin through a concurrent compact.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211215202326/https://www.mcc.gov/news-and-events/release/press-release-121521-board-selects-belize-zambia|archive-date=15 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-12-16|title=Recul de la démocratie: les Etats-Unis sanctionnent le Bénin à travers le MCC|url=https://lanouvelletribune.info/2021/12/recul-de-la-democratie-les-etats-unis-sanctionnent-le-benin-a-travers-le-mcc/|access-date=2021-12-16|website=La Nouvelle Tribune|language=fr|archive-date=16 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211216181132/https://lanouvelletribune.info/2021/12/recul-de-la-democratie-les-etats-unis-sanctionnent-le-benin-a-travers-le-mcc/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Hirschel-Burns|first=Tim|title=Benin's King of Cotton Makes Its Democracy a Sham|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/04/08/benin-election-democracy-sham-patrice-talon/|access-date=2021-12-16|website=Foreign Policy|date=8 April 2021 |language=en-US|archive-date=16 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211216181132/https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/04/08/benin-election-democracy-sham-patrice-talon/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Benin shows some variation in elevation and can be divided into 4 areas from the south to the north, starting with the lower-lying, sandy, coastal plain (highest elevation {{convert|10|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}) which is, at most, {{convert|10|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} wide. It is marshy and dotted with lakes and lagoons communicating with the ocean.

Annual rainfall in the coastal area averages 1300&nbsp;mm or about 51&nbsp;inches. Benin has 2 rainy and 2 dry seasons per year. The principal rainy season is from April to late July, with a shorter less intense rainy period from September to November. The main dry season is from December to April, with a cooler dry season from July to September. Temperatures and humidity are higher along the tropical coast. In [[Cotonou]], the average maximum temperature is {{convert|31|°C|1}}; the minimum is {{convert|24|°C|1}}.<ref name=bn/>

Variations in temperature increase when moving north through [[savanna]] and plateau toward the [[Sahel]]. A dry wind from the Sahara called the [[Harmattan]] blows from December to March, when grass dries up, other vegetation turns reddish brown, and a veil of fine dust hangs over the country, causing the skies to be ""overcast"". It is also the season when farmers burn brush in the fields.<ref name=bn/>

[[File:Extensive Landwirtschaft im Norden Benins bei Djougou.jpg|thumb|Extensive agriculture in the north of Benin, near Djougou.]]
[[File:GDP per capita development of Benin.svg|thumb|Real GDP per capita development of Benin since 1950]]
The economy is dependent on [[subsistence agriculture]], [[cotton]] production, and regional trade. Cotton accounts for 40% of the [[GDP]] and roughly 80% of official [[export]] receipts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6761.htm|title=Background Note: Benin|publisher=State.gov|date=3 February 2010|access-date=2 May 2010|archive-date=4 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604183410/https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6761.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Real GDP growth was estimated at 5.1 and 5.7% in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The main driver of growth is the agricultural sector, with cotton being the main export, while services continue to contribute the largest part of GDP mostly because of Benin's geographical location, enabling trade, transportation, transit and tourism activities with its neighboring states.<ref>{{cite web |title=Benin: Financial Sector Overview |website=Making Finance Work for Africa |url=https://www.mfw4a.org/country/benin |access-date=30 November 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513105544/http://www.mfw4a.org/benin/benin-financial-sector-profile.html |archive-date=13 May 2011 }}</ref> Benin's overall macroeconomic conditions were ""positive"" in 2017, with a growth rate of around 5.6%.

A source of revenue is the Port of Cotonou, and the government is seeking to expand its revenue base. In 2017, Benin imported about $2.8 billion in goods such as rice, meat and poultry, alcoholic beverages, fuel plastic materials, specialized mining and excavating machinery, telecommunications equipment, passenger vehicles, and toiletries and cosmetics.

In order to raise growth still further, Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis on [[Tourism in Benin|tourism]], facilitate the development of new food processing systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and communication technology. Projects to improve the business climate by reforms to the land tenure system, the commercial justice system, and the financial sector were included in Benin's US$307 million [[Millennium Challenge Account]] grant signed in February 2006.<ref name=MCC>{{cite web|title=2006 Benin Compact Summary|website=Millennium Challenge Corporation|date=2006|url=https://assets.mcc.gov/agreements/022206_benin_compact_summary.pdf|access-date=16 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203153130/https://assets.mcc.gov/agreements/022206_benin_compact_summary.pdf|archive-date=3 February 2016}}</ref>

The [[Paris Club]] and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt situation, with Benin benefiting from a G8 debt reduction announced in July 2005, while pressing for more rapid structural reforms.

While [[trade unions in Benin]] represent up to 75% of the formal workforce, the informal economy has been noted by the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITCU) to contain ongoing problems, including a lack of women's wage equality, the use of [[child labour|child labor]], and the continuing issue of [[unfree labour|forced labor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Serious violations of core labour standards in Benin, Burkina Faso and Mali|work=ICFTU Online|url=http://www.icftu.org/displaydocument.asp?Index=991220267&Language=EN|access-date=30 July 2007|archive-date=4 September 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220904222240/https://www.viasatprovider.com/?Index=991220267&Language=EN|url-status=live}}</ref> Benin is a member of the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] ([[OHADA]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=OHADA.com: The business law portal in Africa|url=http://www.ohada.com/index.php|access-date=22 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326033744/http://www.ohada.com/index.php|archive-date=26 March 2009}}</ref>

Cotonou has the country's only seaport and [[Cadjehoun Airport|international airport]]. Benin is connected by 2-lane asphalted roads to its neighboring countries (Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria). Mobile telephone service is available across the country through [[Mobile Network Code|operators]]. ADSL connections are available in some areas. Benin is connected to the Internet by way of satellite connections (since 1998) and a single submarine cable [[SAT-3/WASC (cable system)|SAT-3/WASC]] (since 2001). Relief of ""high price"" is expected with the initiation of the [[ACE (cable system)|Africa Coast to Europe]] cable in 2011.

===Science and technology===

==== National policy framework ====
The [[Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research]] is responsible for implementing science policy. The [[National Directorate of Scientific and Technological Research]] handles planning and coordination whereas the [[National Council for Scientific and Technical Research and National Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters]] each play an advisory role. Financial support comes from Benin's [[National Fund for Scientific Research and Technological Innovation]]. [[The Benin Agency for the Promotion of Research Results and Technological Innovation]] carries out technology transfer through the development and dissemination of research results.<ref name="":0"" /> Benin was ranked 120th in the [[Global Innovation Index]] in 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |last=WIPO |title=Global Innovation Index 2023, 15th Edition |url=https://www.wipo.int/global_innovation_index/en/2023/index.html |access-date=2023-10-30 |website=www.wipo.int |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-10-28|title=Global Innovation Index|url=https://knowledge.insead.edu/entrepreneurship-innovation/global-innovation-index-2930|access-date=2021-09-02|website=INSEAD Knowledge|language=en|archive-date=2 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210902101622/https://knowledge.insead.edu/entrepreneurship-innovation/global-innovation-index-2930|url-status=live}}</ref>

The regulatory framework has evolved since 2006 when the a science policy was prepared. This has been updated and complemented by new texts on science and innovation (the year of adoption is between brackets):<ref name="":0"" />
* a manual for monitoring and evaluating research structures and organizations (2013);
* a manual on how to select research programmes and projects and apply to the National Fund for Scientific Research and Technological Innovation (2013) for competitive grants;
* a draft act for funding scientific research and innovation and a draft code of ethics for scientific research and innovation were both submitted to the Supreme Court in 2014;
* a strategic plan for scientific research and innovation (under development in 2015).
Equally important are Benin's efforts to integrate science into existing policy documents:
* ''Benin Development Strategies 2025'': ''Benin 2025 Alafia'' (2000);
* Growt''h Strategy for Poverty Reduction 2011–2016'' (2011);
* Phase 3 of the ''Ten-year Development Plan for the Education Sector'', covering 2013–2015;
* ''Development Plan for Higher Education and Scientific Research 2013–2017'' (2014).
In 2015, Benin's priority areas for scientific research were: health, education, construction and building materials, transportation and trade, culture, tourism and handicrafts, cotton/textiles, food, energy and climate change.<ref name="":0"" />

Some so-called challenges facing research and development in Benin are:<ref name="":0"" />
* the unfavorable organizational framework for research: weak governance, a lack of co-operation between research structures and the absence of an official document on the status of researchers;
* the inadequate use of human resources and the lack of any motivational policy for researchers; and 
* the mismatch between research and development needs.

==== Human and financial investment in research ====
In 2007, Benin counted 1,000 researchers (in headcounts). This corresponds to 115 researchers per million inhabitants. The ""main research structures"" are the Centre for Scientific and Technical Research, National Institute of Agricultural Research, National Institute for Training and Research in Education, Office of Geological and Mining Research and the Centre for Entomological Research.<ref name="":0"" />

The University of Abomey-Calavi was selected by the [[World Bank]] in 2014 to participate in its Centres of Excellence project, owing to its expertise in applied mathematics. Within this project, the World Bank has loaned $8 million to Benin. The Association of African Universities has received funds to enable it to co-ordinate knowledge-sharing among the 19 universities in West Africa involved in the project.<ref name="":0"" />

There are ""no available data"" on Benin's level of investment in research and development.<ref name="":0"" />

In 2013, the government devoted 2.5% of GDP to public health. In December 2014, 150 volunteer health professionals travelled to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria, as part of a joint initiative by the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and its specialized agency, the West African Health Organisation, to help combat the epidemic. The Ebola epidemic has been a reminder of the underinvestment in West African health systems.<ref name="":0"" />

The Government of Benin devoted less than 5% of GDP to agricultural development in 2010, while the members of the [[African Union]] had agreed to commit at least 10% of GDP to this area in the ''Maputo Declaration'' of 2003. They reiterated this goal in the ''Malabo Declaration'' adopted in Equatorial Guinea in 2014. In the latter declaration, they reaffirmed their 'intention to devote 10% of their national budgets to agricultural development and agreed to targets such as doubling agricultural productivity, halving post-harvest loss and bringing stunting down to 10% across Africa'. African leaders meeting in Equatorial Guinea failed to resolve the debate on establishing a common standard of measurement for the 10% target.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.one.org/africa/press/one-applauds-au-malabo-declarations-re-commitment-to-agriculture-transformation/|title=One Applauds AU Malabo Declaration's Recommitment to Agriculture Transformation|date=2 July 2014|work=ONE.org|access-date=12 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010183945/https://www.one.org/africa/press/one-applauds-au-malabo-declarations-re-commitment-to-agriculture-transformation/|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Research output ====
Benin has the third-highest publication intensity for scientific journals in West Africa, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, Science Citation Index Expanded. There were 25.5 scientific articles per million inhabitants cataloged in this database in 2014. This compares with 65.0 for the Gambia, 49.6 for Cape Verde, 23.2 for Senegal and 21.9 for Ghana. The volume of publications in this database tripled in Benin between 2005 and 2014 from 86 to 270. Between 2008 and 2014, Benin's ""main scientific collaborators"" were based in France (529 articles), United States (261), United Kingdom (254), Belgium (198) and Germany (156).<ref name="":0"" />

===Transportation===
{{main|Transport in Benin}}
[[Transport in Benin]] includes road, rail, water and air transportation. Benin possesses a total of 6,787&nbsp;km of [[highway]], of which 1,357&nbsp;km are paved. Of the paved highways in the country, there are 10 [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]]. This leaves 5,430&nbsp;km of unpaved road. The [[Trans–West African Coastal Highway|Trans-West African Coastal Highway]] crosses Benin, connecting it to [[Nigeria]] to the east, and [[Togo]], [[Ghana]] and [[Ivory Coast]] to the west. When construction in [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]] is finished, the highway will continue west to 7 other [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) nations. A paved highway connects Benin northwards to [[Niger]], and through that country to [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]] to the north-west.

[[Rail transport in Benin]] consists of {{convert|578|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of [[Single track (rail)|single track]], {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}} railway. Construction work has commenced on international lines connecting Benin with Niger and Nigeria, with outline plans announced for further connections to Togo and Burkina Faso. Benin will be a participant in the [[AfricaRail]] project.

[[Cadjehoun Airport]], located at Cotonou, has direct international jet service to [[Accra]], Niamey, [[Monrovia]], [[Lagos]], [[Ouagadougou]], [[Lomé]], and [[Douala]], and other cities in Africa. Direct services link Cotonou to Paris, Brussels, and Istanbul.

The international exhibition and artistic program of the 2012 Biennale Benin are curated by Abdellah Karroum and the Curatorial Delegation.{{cn|date=July 2023}}

===Customary names===
Some Beninese in the south of the country have [[Akan name|Akan-based names]] indicating the day of the week on which they were born. This is due to influence of the [[Akan people]] such as the [[Akwamu]] and others.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Akwamu |author=((Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica)) |date=2000 |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online |title=Akwamu: historical state, Africa |access-date=27 August 2022 |archive-date=29 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220429211843/https://www.britannica.com/place/Akwamu |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Language===
{{main|Languages of Benin}}
Local languages are used as the many languages of instruction in elementary schools, with French introduced after years. At the secondary school level, French is the sole language of instruction. Beninese languages are ""generally transcribed"" with a separate letter for each speech sound ([[phoneme]]), rather than using [[diacritic]]s as in French or [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] as in English. This includes Beninese [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], which in [[Nigeria]] is written with both diacritics and digraphs. For instance, the [[mid vowel]]s written ''é, è, ô, o'' in French are written ''{{IPA|e, ɛ, o, ɔ}}'' in Beninese languages, whereas the [[consonant]]s are written ''ng'' and ''sh'' or ''ch'' in English are written ''ŋ'' and ''c.'' Digraphs are used for [[nasal vowel]]s and the [[labial-velar consonant]]s ''kp'' and ''gb,'' as in the name of the [[Fon language]] ''Fon gbe'' {{IPA|/fõ ɡ͡be/}}, and diacritics are used as [[tone (linguistics)|tone marks]]. In French-language publications, a mixture of French and Beninese orthographies may be seen.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Bahia acaraje.jpg|thumb|[[Acarajé]] is peeled [[black-eyed pea]]s formed into a ball and then deep-fried.]]
{{main|Benin cuisine}}
The cuisine involves fresh meals served with a variety of key sauces. In southern Benin cuisine, an ingredient is [[Maize|corn]] which has been used to prepare [[dough]] which has been served with [[peanut]]- or [[tomato]]-based [[sauce]]s. [[Fish]] and [[chicken]], [[beef]], [[goat]], and [[Aethomys|bush rat]] are consumed. A staple in northern Benin is [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]] which has been served with sauces mentioned above. The population in the northern provinces use beef and [[pork]] meat which is fried in palm or peanut oil or cooked in sauces. [[Cheese]] is used in some dishes. [[Couscous]], rice, and [[bean]]s are eaten, along with fruits such as [[mango]]es, oranges, avocados, bananas, kiwi fruit, and pineapples.

Meals are said to be generally light on meat and generous on [[vegetable fat]]. Frying in palm or peanut oil is a meat preparation, and [[smoked fish]] is prepared in Benin. Grinders are used to prepare [[Cornmeal|corn flour]], which is made into a dough and served with sauces. ""[[Rotisserie chicken|Chicken on the spit]]"" is a recipe in which chicken is roasted over a fire on wooden sticks. [[Arecaceae|Palm]] roots are sometimes soaked in a jar with salt water and sliced garlic to tenderize them, then used in dishes. Some people have outdoor mud stoves for cooking.{{cn|date=August 2023}}

=== Traditional authorities ===
Benin has numerous [[Non-sovereign monarchy|non-sovereign monarchies]] within the country, many of them derivative of pre-colonial kingdoms (such as [[Kingdom of Ardra|Arda]]). Non-sovereign monarchs do not have an official, constitutional role, and are largely ceremonial and subservient to political and civil authorities. Despite this, they play an influential role in local political matters within their particular realms and are often courted by Beninese politicians for electoral support. Advocacy groups such as the [[High Council of Kings of Benin]] represent the monarchs nationally.<ref>{{Cite report |author=Research Directorate |publisher=[[Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada]] |location=Ottawa |type=Response to Information Request |date=2016-05-04 |title=Benin: Kings in northern Benin, specifically in Borgou department; extent of their power in comparison with the power of political and civil authorities; a king's ability to force a woman to marry him; remedies available to a woman who refuses to marry a king (2014-April 2016) |docket=BEN105509.FE |url=https://www.ecoi.net/en/document/1393811.html |access-date=2022-08-27 |via=European Country of Origin Information Network |language=en |archive-date=6 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210506152051/https://www.ecoi.net/en/document/1393811.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Monde: Haïti veut punir les crimes vaudous comme au Benin |url=http://news.anmwe.com/monde-haiti-veut-punir-les-crimes-vaudous-comme-au-benin/ |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=Anmwe News |date=10 October 2017 |language=fr |archive-date=27 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220827071551/http://news.anmwe.com/monde-haiti-veut-punir-les-crimes-vaudous-comme-au-benin/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

It is unclear when [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples first moved into the country from the north, although 600 CE seems to be a consensus estimate. In that era the ancestors of the modern-day [[Kalanga people|Kalanga]] moved into what is now the north-eastern areas of the country. These proto-Kalanga were closely connected to states in [[Zimbabwe]] as well as to the [[Mapungubwe]] state and the notable of these was [[Domboshaba]] ruins, a cultural and heritage site in Botswana originally occupied towards the end of the Great Zimbabwe period (1250–1450), with stone walls that have an average height of 1.8 metres. The site is a respected place for the people living in the region and it is believed that the chief lived on the top of the hill together with his helpers or assistants. These states, located outside of current Botswana's borders, appear to have kept massive herds of cattle in what is now the Central District—apparently at numbers approaching modern cattle density.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=181334 |doi=10.1017/S0021853700029170|title=A New Look at the Later Prehistory of the Kalahari|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–28|last1=Denbow|first1=James|year=1986|s2cid=163079138}}</ref> This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until 1300 CE or so and seems to have regressed following the collapse of Mapungubwe. During this era the first Tswana-speaking groups, the [[Bakgalagadi]], moved into the southern areas of the [[Kalahari]]. All these various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the Limpopo River to the Indian Ocean, and trade goods from Asia such as beads made their way to Botswana, most likely in exchange for ivory, gold and [[rhinoceros horn]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Denbow|first1=James|last2=Klehm|first2=Carla|last3=Dussubieux|first3=Laure|date=April 2015|title=The glass beads of Kaitshàa and early Indian Ocean trade into the far interior of southern Africa|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/glass-beads-of-kaitshaa-and-early-indian-ocean-trade-into-the-far-interior-of-southern-africa/9BB659F4DA38A560EF64C4E8E3F49AFA|journal=Antiquity|language=en|volume=89|issue=344|pages=361–377|doi=10.15184/aqy.2014.50|s2cid=161212483|issn=0003-598X}}</ref>

[[Toutswemogala Hill]] Iron Age Settlement's radio-carbon dates for this settlement range from 7th to late 19th century indicating occupation of more than one thousand years. The hill was part of the formation of early states in Southern Africa with cattle keeping as major source of economy. Toutswe settlement include house-floors, large heaps of vitrified cow-dung and burials while the outstanding structure is the stone wall. There are large tracts of centaurs ciliaris, a type of grass which has come to be associated with cattle-keeping settlements in South, Central Africa. Around 700 CE, the [[Toutswe]] people moved westward into Botswana and began an agricultural and pastoral land tenure system based on [[sorghum]] and [[millet]], and domesticated stock, respectively.<ref name=Hall>Hall, Martin (1990), ''Farmers, Kings, and Traders: The People of Southern Africa, 200-1860'', University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-31326-3}}.</ref> The site was situated in the centre of a broader cultural area in Eastern Botswana and shares many commonalities with other archaeological sites of this region, in both ceramic production styles and also time frames inhabited. Large structures were observed that contained vitrified remains of animal dung, leading to the theory that these were animal enclosures and that Toutswemogala Hill was thus a major centre of animal husbandry in the region.<ref name=Hall />

However, agriculture also played a vital role in the longevity of Toutswemogala Hill's extended occupation, as many grain storage structures have also been found on the site. Many different stratified layers of housing floors further signal continuous occupation over hundreds of years. The arrival of the ancestors of the Tswana-speakers who came to control the region has yet to be dated precisely. Members of the [[Bakwena]], a chieftaincy under a legendary leader named Kgabo II, made their way into the southern Kalahari by 1500 CE, at the latest, and his people drove the Bakgalagadi inhabitants west into the desert. Over the years, several offshoots of the Bakwena moved into adjoining territories. The [[Bangwaketse]] occupied areas to the west, while the [[Bangwato]] moved northeast into formerly Kalanga areas.<ref>[[David Magang|Magang, D.]] (2008) ''The Magic of Perseverance: The Autobiography of David Magang''. Cape Town: CASAS, pp. 10–14; {{ISBN|9781920287702}}</ref> Not long afterwards, a Bangwato offshoot known as the Batawana migrated into the Okavango Delta, probably in the 1790s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tlou|first=T.|date=1974|title=The Nature of Batswana States: Towards a Theory of Batswana Traditional Government – The Batawana Case|journal=Botswana Notes and Records|volume=6|pages=57–75|jstor=40959210|issn=0525-5090}}</ref>

===Effects of the Mfecane and Batswana-Boer Wars===

[[File:Kapstaaten 1905.png|thumb|left|German map of 1905 still showing the undivided Bechuanaland area]]
The first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appear in 1824. What these records show is that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their neighbours.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morton|first=Fred|title=The Rise of a Raiding State: Makaba II's Ngwaketse, 1780–1824|url=https://www.academia.edu/11134264}}</ref> Other chiefdoms in the area, by this time, had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Morton, B. |title=Pre-1904 Population Estimates of the Tswana|journal=Botswana Notes and Records|volume=25 |year=1993|pages=89–99|jstor=40979984 }}</ref> This equilibrium came to end during the [[Mfecane]] period, 1823–1843, when a succession of invading peoples from South Africa entered the country. Although the Bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading [[Makololo tribe|Bakololo]] in 1826, over time all the major chiefdoms in Botswana were attacked, weakened, and impoverished. The Bakololo and [[Northern Ndebele people|AmaNdebele]] raided repeatedly and took large numbers of cattle, women, and children from the Batswana—most of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves. Only after 1843, when the Amandebele moved into western Zimbabwe, did this threat subside.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morton |first=Barry|date=2009-01-14|title=The Hunting Trade and the Reconstruction of Northern Tswana Societies after the Difaqane, 1838–1880|journal=South African Historical Journal|volume=36|pages=220–239|language=en|doi=10.1080/02582479708671276}}</ref>

During the 1840s and 1850s trade with [[Cape Colony]]-based merchants opened up and enabled the [[Batswana]] chiefdoms to rebuild. The [[Bakwena]], Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by 1880, and thus the Bushmen, the Kalanga, the Bakgalagadi, and other current minorities were subjugated by the Batswana.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/02582479708671276|title=The Hunting Trade and the Reconstruction of Northern Tswana Societies after the Difaqane, 1838–1880|journal=South African Historical Journal|volume=36|pages=220–239|year=1997|last1=Morton|first1=Barry}}</ref> The earliest known map of Botswana dates from 1849, drawn by [[David Livingstone]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC8LRI7cCvM] timestamp 45:20</ref>

Following the [[Great Trek]], [[Afrikaners]] from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. In 1852 a coalition of [[Tswana people|Tswana]] chiefdoms led by [[Sechele I]] defeated Afrikaner incursions at the [[Battle of Dimawe]] and, after about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in Potchefstroom in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together comparatively peacefully.<ref>[[David Magang|Magang, D.]] (2008) ''The Magic of Perseverance: The Autobiography of David Magang''.

In 1884 Batawana, a northern based Tswana clan's cavalry under the command of Kgosi Moremi fought and defeated the Ndebele's invasion of northern Botswana at the Battle of Khutiyabasadi. This blow to the larger invading Ndebele force signalled the start of the collapse of the Ndebele Kingdom in Zimbabwe and helped galvanise Tswana speaking authority of the area now making part of northern Botswana.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?aid=72905&dir=2017/november/06|title=Mmegi Blogs :: The Guns of Khutiyabasadi (II)|last=Ramsay|first=Jeff|work=Mmegi Blogs|access-date=2018-11-08|archive-date=24 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124091704/https://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?aid=72905&dir=2017/november/06|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Due to newly peaceful conditions, trade thrived between 1860 and 1880. Taking advantage of this were Christian [[Missionary|missionaries]]. The [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] and the [[London Missionary Society]] both became established in the country by 1856. By 1880, every major village had a resident missionary, and their influence slowly became felt. [[Khama III]] (reigned 1875–1923) was the first of the Tswana chiefs to make Christianity a state religion and changed a great deal of Tswana customary law as a result. Christianity became the de facto official religion in all the chiefdoms by World War I.<ref>Landau, P.

During the [[Scramble for Africa]] the territory of Botswana was coveted by both the [[German Empire]] and Britain. During the [[Berlin Conference]], Britain decided to annex Botswana in order to safeguard the Road to the North and thus connect the Cape Colony to its territories further north. It unilaterally annexed Tswana territories in January 1885 and then sent the [[Warren Expedition]] north to consolidate control over the area and convince the chiefs to accept British overrule. Despite their misgivings, they eventually acquiesced to this ''[[Glossary of French expressions in English#Fait accompli|fait accompli]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/15645705 |title=The Invention and Perpetuation of Botswana's National Mythology, 1885–1966 |last1=Morton |first1=Barry |last2=Ramsay |first2=Jeff |pages=4–7 |access-date=13 July 2018 |via=academia.edu}}</ref><ref>""Warren informed Chiefs Bathoen of Bangwaketse, Khama of Bangwato and Sebele of Bakwena about the protection in May 1885 (Mogalakwe, 2006).""

In 1890 areas north of 22 degrees were added to the new [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]]. During the 1890s the new territory was divided into eight different reserves, with fairly small amounts of land being left as freehold for white [[settlers]]. During the early 1890s, the British government decided to hand over the Bechuanaland Protectorate to the [[British South Africa Company]]. This plan, which was well on its way to fruition despite the entreaties of Tswana leaders who toured England in protest, was eventually foiled by the failure of the [[Jameson Raid]] in January 1896.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/15645705 |title=The Invention and Perpetuation of Botswana's National Mythology, 1885–1966 |last1=Morton |first1=Barry |last2=Ramsay |first2=Jeff |access-date=13 July 2018 |via=academia.edu|pages=7–11}}</ref><ref>Parsons, N.

[[File:1960 6d Bechuanaland Protectorate stamp.jpg|thumb|Postage stamp of British-ruled [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]] from 1960]]
When the [[Union of South Africa]] was formed in 1910 from the main British colonies in the region, the High Commission Territories—the Bechuanaland Protectorate, [[Basutoland]] (now [[Lesotho]]), and [[Swaziland]] (now [[Eswatini]])—were not included, but provision was made for their later incorporation. However, the UK began to consult with their inhabitants as to their wishes. Although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred to their jurisdiction, the UK kept delaying; consequently, it never occurred. The election of the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist]] government in 1948, which instituted [[apartheid]], and South Africa's withdrawal from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1961, ended any prospect of the UK or these territories agreeing to incorporation into South Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Frank|date=1980|title=South Africa's Departure from the Commonwealth, 1960–1961|journal=The International History Review|volume=2|issue=3|pages=453–484|doi=10.1080/07075332.1980.9640222|jstor=40105085|issn=0707-5332}}</ref>

[[Queen Elizabeth II]], accompanied by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] and her son [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]], arrived in Botswana during the fourth-leg tour of Africa on 25–27 July 1979. During their visit, they were greeted by tribal dancers and a 21-gun salute.

Khama died in office in 1980. The presidency passed to the sitting vice-president, [[Quett Masire]], who was elected in his own right in 1984 and re-elected in 1989 and 1994. Masire retired from office in 1998. He was succeeded by [[Festus Mogae]], who was elected in his own right in 1999 and re-elected in 2004. The presidency passed in 2008 to [[Ian Khama]] (son of the first president), who had been serving as Mogae's vice-president since resigning his position in 1998 as Commander of the [[Botswana Defence Force]] to take up this civilian role. On 1 April 2018 [[Mokgweetsi Masisi|Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi]] was sworn in as the fifth president of Botswana, succeeding Ian Khama.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Botswana|Climate of Botswana|Climate Change in Botswana}}
[[File:Botswana map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Botswana map of [[Köppen climate classification]]]]
At {{convert|581730|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} Botswana is the world's 48th-largest country. It is similar in size to Madagascar or France. It lies between latitudes 17° and 27° south, and longitudes 20° and 30° east.

Botswana is predominantly flat, tending towards gently rolling [[plateau|tableland]]. Botswana is dominated by the [[Kalahari Desert]], which covers up to 70% of its land surface. The [[Okavango Delta]], one of the world's largest inland [[river deltas]], is in the north-west. The [[Makgadikgadi Pan]], a large [[salt pan (geology)|salt pan]], lies in the north.

The [[Limpopo River]] Basin, the major landform of all of southern Africa, lies partly in Botswana, with the basins of its tributaries, the [[Notwane River|Notwane]], [[Bonwapitse River|Bonwapitse]], [[Mahalapye]], [[Lotsane River|Lotsane]], [[Motloutse River|Motloutse]] and the [[Shashe River|Shashe]], located in the eastern part of the country. The Notwane provides water to the capital through the [[Gaborone Dam]]. The [[Cuando River|Chobe River]] lies to the north, providing a boundary between Botswana and Namibia's [[Zambezi Region]]. The Chobe River meets with the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]] at a place called [[Kazungula]] (meaning a small [[sausage tree]], a point where [[Sebitwane]] and his [[Makololo|Makololo tribe]] crossed the Zambezi into Zambia).

===Biodiversity and conservation===
{{Main|Wildlife of Botswana}}
[[File:Cebras de Burchell (Equus quagga burchellii), vista aérea del delta del Okavango, Botsuana, 2018-08-01, DD 28.jpg|thumb|Zebras roaming the Okavango Basin]]
Botswana has diverse areas of wildlife habitat. In addition to the delta and desert areas, there are [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s, where [[blue wildebeest]], [[antelope]]s, and other mammals and birds are found. Northern Botswana has one of the few remaining large populations of the endangered [[African wild dog]]. [[Chobe National Park]], found in the [[Chobe District]], has the world's largest concentration of [[African bush elephant|African elephant]]s. The park covers about {{convert|11000|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and supports about 350 species of birds.

The Chobe National Park and [[Moremi Game Reserve]] (in the Okavango Delta) are major tourist destinations. Other reserves include the [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]] located in the Kalahari Desert in [[Ghanzi District]]; [[Makgadikgadi Pans National Park]] and [[Nxai Pan National Park]] are in [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]] in the [[Makgadikgadi Pan]]. Mashatu Game Reserve is privately owned, located at the confluence of the [[Shashe River|Shashe]] and Limpopo Rivers in eastern Botswana. The other privately owned reserve is [[Mokolodi Nature Reserve]] near Gaborone. There are also specialised sanctuaries like [[Khama Rhino Sanctuary]] (for [[rhinoceros]]) and Makgadikgadi Sanctuary (for [[flamingo]]s). They are both located in Central District.

Botswana faces two major [[Natural environment|environment]]al problems, drought and [[desertification]], which are heavily linked. Three-quarters of the country's human and animal populations depend on groundwater due to drought. [[Groundwater]] use through deep borehole drilling has somewhat eased the effects of drought. Surface water is scarce in Botswana and less than 5% of the agriculture in the country is sustainable by rainfall. In the remaining 95% of the country, raising livestock is the primary source of rural income. Approximately 71% of the country's land is used for communal grazing, which has been a major cause of the desertification and the accelerating soil erosion of the country.<ref name=""rala.is"">{{cite web | publisher = Rala | location = IS | url = http://www.rala.is/rade/ralareport/darkoh.pdf | title = Darkoh | access-date = 30 March 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101010191509/http://www.rala.is/rade/ralareport/darkoh.pdf | archive-date = 10 October 2010 | url-status = dead}}</ref>

Since raising livestock has been profitable for the people of Botswana, they continue to exploit the land with dramatically increasing numbers of animals. From 1966 to 1991, the livestock population grew from 1.7 million to 5.5 million.<ref name = ""rala.is"" />{{rp |64}} Similarly, the human population has increased from 574,000 in 1971 to 1.5 million in 1995, a 161% increase in 24 years. Over 50% of all households in Botswana own cattle, which is currently the largest single source of rural income. Rangeland degradation or desertification is regarded as the reduction in land productivity as a result of overstocking and overgrazing, or as a result of veld product gathering for commercial use. Degradation is exacerbated by the effects of drought and climate change.<ref name = ""rala.is"" />

Environmentalists report that the [[Okavango Delta]] is drying up due to the increased grazing of livestock.<ref name=""afrol.com"">{{cite web |url= http://www.afrol.com/articles/21794 |title= Botswana, US sign 'Debt-for-Nature' agreement |publisher= Afrol |access-date= 4 July 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091201140712/http://www.afrol.com/articles/21794 |archive-date= 1 December 2009 |url-status= live}}</ref> The Okavango Delta is one of the major semi-forested wetlands in Botswana and one of the largest inland deltas in the world; it is a crucial ecosystem to the survival of many animals.<ref name=""afrol.com""/>

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] claims that poverty is a major problem behind the [[overexploitation]] of resources, including land, in Botswana. To help change this the UNDP joined in with a project started in the southern community of Struizendam in Botswana. The purpose of the project is to draw from ""indigenous knowledge and traditional land management systems"". The leaders of this movement are supposed to be the people in the community, to draw them in, in turn increasing their possibilities to earn an income and thus decreasing poverty. The UNDP also stated that the government has to effectively implement policies to allow people to manage their own local resources and are giving the government information to help with policy development.<ref name=""afrol1"">{{cite web |url = http://www.afrol.com/articles/13090 |title = Botswana villages fighting desertification |publisher = Afrol |access-date = 4 July 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091102221242/http://www.afrol.com/articles/13090 |archive-date = 2 November 2009 |url-status = live}}</ref>

On 24 August 2018 the UN Special Rapporteur on Minorities, Fernand de Varennes, issued a statement calling on Botswana ""to step up efforts to recognise and protect the rights of minorities in relation to public services, land and resource use and the use of minority languages in education and other critical areas.""{{cn|date=December 2023}}

Botswana was ranked as a ""flawed democracy"" and 30th out of 167 states in the 2021 [[Democracy Index|Democracy Index (The Economist)]], higher than [[Italy]] and [[Belgium]], and just below the [[Czech Republic]]. This was the second highest rating in Africa, and highest ranking in continental Africa (only the offshore island nation of [[Mauritius]] bested its ranking). According to 2023 [[V-Dem Democracy indices]] Botswana ranks as 75th electoral democracy worldwide and 12th [[democracy in Africa|electoral democracy in Africa]]. According to [[Transparency International]], Botswana is the least corrupt country in Africa and ranks just below Portugal and South Korea.<ref>Transparency International [https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020/index/nzl].

The constitution provides for an independent judiciary, and the government respects this in practice. The legal system is sufficient to conduct secure commercial dealings, although a serious and growing backlog of cases prevents timely trials. The protection of intellectual property rights has improved significantly.

While generally open to foreign participation in its economy, Botswana reserves some sectors for citizens. Increased foreign investment plays a significant role in the privatisation of state-owned enterprises. Investment regulations are transparent, and bureaucratic procedures are streamlined and open, although somewhat slow. Investment returns such as profits and dividends, debt service, capital gains, returns on intellectual property, royalties, franchise's fees, and service fees can be repatriated without limits.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Botswana imports refined petroleum products and electricity from South Africa. There is some domestic production of electricity from coal.

{{Main|Languages of Botswana|Setswana}}
The official language of Botswana is English, while [[Tswana language|Setswana]] is widely spoken across the country.<ref name=""gov.bw languages"" /> In Setswana, [[prefix]]es are more important than they are in many other languages, since Setswana is a [[Bantu language]] and has noun classes denoted by these prefixes. They include ''Bo'', which refers to the country, ''Ba'', which refers to the people, ''Mo'', which is one person, and ''Se'' which is the language. For example, the main ethnic group of Botswana is the Tswana people, hence the name Botswana for its country. The people as a whole are Batswana, one person is a Motswana, and the language they speak is Setswana.

Other languages spoken in Botswana include [[Kalanga language|Kalanga]] (Sekalanga), [[Tshwa language|Sarwa]] (Sesarwa), [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]], Kgalagadi, Tswapong, [[Taa language|!Xóõ]], Yeyi, and, in some parts, [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]].

An estimated 77% of the country's citizens identify as [[Christians]]. [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], and the [[United Congregational Church of Southern Africa]] make up the majority of Christians. There are also congregations of [[Lutheran]]s, [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], [[Mennonite]]s, [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Serbian Orthodoxy|Serbian Orthodox]] in the country.

Approximately 20% of citizens identify with [[Irreligion|no religion]].

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Botswana}}

===Literature and cinema===
Botswana literature belongs somewhere in the strong African literary writing circles. African literature is known for its consciousness and [[Didacticism|didactic]] writing styles. Writing as an art form has existed in Botswana for a long while, from the rock painting era — especially in the [[Tsodilo Hills]], known to be 20,000 years old — to the present day, with the movie production of ''[[The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency]]'', based on a series of more than 20 novels set in Botswana.
[[File:Unity Dow - PopTech 2011 - Camden Maine USA (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Unity Dow]], author of ''Far and Beyon''', ''The Screaming of the Innocent'', and ''Heavens May Fall'']]
In recent times and to date Botswana has seen a remarkable appearance of distinguished writers whose genres range from historical, political and witty story writing. Prominent amongst these are the South African-born [[Bessie Head]], who settled in [[Serowe]]; [[Andrew Sesinyi]]; [[Barolong Seboni]] (whose works include ''Images of the Sun'', ''Screams and Pleas'', ''Lovesongs'', ''Windsongs of the Kgalagadi'' and ''Lighting the Fire'', and several other publications that include a play, ''Sechele I'', and ''Setswana Riddles Translated into English''); [[Unity Dow]], [[Galesiti Baruti]]; [[Caitlin Davies]]; [[Lauri Kubuetsile]]; [[Albert Malikongwa]]; [[Toro Mositi]]; and [[Moteane Melamu]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@africadialogue/the-history-and-future-of-literature-in-botswana-dc0120b34561|title=The History and Future of Literature in Botswana|first=Africa in|last=Dialogue|date=12 July 2017|website=Medium}}</ref>

Most of Bessie Head's important works are set in Serowe. ''[[When Rain Clouds Gather]]'' (1968), ''Maru'' (1971), and ''A Question of Power'' (1973) all have this setting. The three are also autobiographical; ''When Rain Clouds Gather'' is based on her experience living on a development farm, Maru incorporates her experience of being considered racially inferior, and ''A Question of Power'' draws on her understanding of what it was like to experience acute [[Mental distress|psychological distress]]. Head also published a number of short stories, including the collection ''The Collector of Treasures'' (1977). She published a book on the history of Serowe, ''Serowe: Village of the Rainwind''. Her last novel, ''A Bewitched Crossroad'' (1984), is historical, set in 19th-century Botswana. She had also written a story of two prophets, one wealthy and one who lived poorly, called ''Jacob: The Faith-Healing Priest''.<ref>Mary Ellen Snodgrass, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LXyyYs2cRDcC&pg=PT141 ""Head, Bessie (Bessie Amelia Emery Head)""], ''Encyclopedia of the Literature of Empire'', Infobase Publishing, 2010, pp. 131–132.</ref><ref name=SAHO>[http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/bessie-amelia-head-sa-novelist-dies ""Bessie Amelia Head, SA novelist dies""], South African History Online, 17 April 1986.</ref>

The 1981 comedy ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]'' was set in Botswana and became a major international hit; 2000's [[Disney]] production ''[[Whispers: An Elephant's Tale]]'' was filmed in Botswana. In 2009, parts of [[M. Saravanan (film producer)|M. Saravanan]]'s Tamil-language Indian action film ''[[Ayan (film)|Ayan]]'' were filmed in Botswana.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

The critically acclaimed ''[[A United Kingdom]]'', about the real-life love story of Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams, was filmed partly between Botswana and London, and was released internationally in 2016.<ref name=""oxfordbibliographies"">{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199846733/obo-9780199846733-0110.xml|title=Botswana (Bechuanaland) – African Studies|website=Oxford Bibliographies|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref>

===Media===

Botswana's music is mostly vocal and performed, sometimes without drums depending on the occasion; it also makes heavy use of string instruments. Botswana folk music has instruments such as setinkane (a sort of miniature piano), segankure/segaba (a Botswanan version of the Chinese instrument [[erhu]]), moropa (meropa -plural) (many varieties of drums), phala (a whistle used mostly during celebrations, which comes in a variety of forms). Botswanan cultural musical instruments are not confined only to the strings or drums. The hands are used as musical instruments too, by either clapping them together or against {{transliteration|tn|phathisi}} (goat skin turned inside out wrapped around the calf area, only used by men) to create music and rhythm. For the last few decades, the guitar has been celebrated as a versatile music instrument for Tswana music as it offers a variety in string which the segaba instrument does not have. The national anthem is ""[[Fatshe leno la rona]]"". Written and composed by [[Kgalemang Tumediso Motsete]], it was adopted upon independence in 1966.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Makgala|first=Christian John|date=2014-07-03|title=Neil Parsons, National Coat of Arms, and Introduction of the Pula Currency in Botswana, 1975–1976|journal=South African Historical Journal|volume=66|issue=3|pages=504–520|doi=10.1080/02582473.2014.898081|s2cid=159475736|issn=0258-2473}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Welcome to Daily News .:.

=== Visual arts ===

In the northern part of Botswana, women in the villages of Etsha and [[Gumare]] are noted for their skill at crafting baskets from Mokola Palm and local [[dye]]s. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage, large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. The artistry of these baskets is being steadily enhanced through colour use and improved designs as they are increasingly produced for international markets.{{sfn|Cunningham|Milton|1987}}

The oldest paintings from both Botswana and South Africa depict hunting, animal and human figures, and were made by the Khoisan (!Kung San/Bushmen) over twenty thousand years ago within the [[Kalahari]] Desert.

===Food===
{{Main|Cuisine of Botswana}}

The cuisine of Botswana mostly includes meat as Botswana is a cattle country. The national dish is [[seswaa]], pounded meat made from goat meat or beef, [[Biltong|Segwapa]] dried, cured meat ranging from beef to game meats & the cut may also vary, either fillets of meat cut into strips following the grain of the muscle, or flat pieces sliced across the grain. Botswana's cuisine shares some characteristics with other cuisine of Southern Africa.

Examples of Botswana food are: [[Bogobe]], [[Pap (food)|pap]] (maize porridge), [[boerewors]], [[samp]], Magwinya (fried dough bread) and [[Imbrasia belina|mopane worms]]. Porridge (bogobe) is made by putting sorghum, maize, or millet flour into boiling water, stirring into a soft paste, and cooking it slowly. A dish called ting is made when the sorghum or maize is fermented, and milk and sugar added. Without the milk and sugar, ting is sometimes eaten with meat or vegetables as lunch or dinner. Another way of making bogobe is to add sour milk and a cooking melon (lerotse). This dish is called tophi by the Kalanga tribe. Madila is a traditional fermented milk product similar to [[yogurt]] or [[sour cream]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Microbiome of madila - a southern-african fermented milk product |last1=Ohenhen |first1=Regina |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315493533 |work=International Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences |volume=2 (2) (2013) 170–175 |pages= |access-date=2023-02-26 |script-title= |publication-date=2013 |author-mask= |last2=Imarenezor |first2=E.P.K |last3=Kihuha |first3=A.N.}}</ref>

Many different kinds of beans are grown, including cowpeas, ditloo, and letlhodi. Some vegetables grow in the wild and are available seasonally including thepe and Delele (okra). Many fruits are locally available, including marula. Watermelons, believed to have come originally from Botswana, are plentiful in season. Another kind of melon, called lerotse or lekatane, is also grown. Some kinds of wild melon found in sandy desert areas are an important food and water source for the people who live in those areas. [[Kgalagadi Breweries Limited]] produces the national beer, St. Louis Lager, Botswana's first and only local beer brand that has also been a part of Botswana's rich history since 1989, and non-alcoholic beverage Keone Mooka Mageu, a traditional fermented porridge.

[[Letsile Tebogo]] set the [[List of world under-20 records in athletics|world junior record]] in the [[100 metres]] with a time of 9.94 at the [[2022 World Athletics Championships]].

On 7 August 2021 Botswana won the bronze medal in the Men's [[4 × 400 metres relay at the Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]].

The card game [[Contract bridge|bridge]] has a strong following; it was first played in Botswana around 40 years ago, and it grew in popularity during the 1980s. Many British expatriate schoolteachers informally taught the game in Botswana's secondary schools. The Botswana Bridge Federation (BBF) was founded in 1988 and continues to organise tournaments.

Botswana has made great strides in educational development since independence in 1966. At that time there were very few graduates in the country and only a very small percentage of the population attended secondary school. Botswana increased its adult literacy rate from 69% in 1991 to 83% in 2008.<ref name=""ref"">{{cite web |url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org |title=UNESCO Institute for Statistics |publisher=Stats.uis.unesco.org |access-date=21 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725065836/http://stats.uis.unesco.org/ |archive-date=25 July 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> Among sub-Saharan African countries, Botswana has one of the highest literacy rates.<ref name=""cia.gov"">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/literacy/|title=Literacy - The World Factbook|website=www.cia.gov}}</ref> According to The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency as of 2015, 88.5% of the population age 15 and over could read and write and were respectively literate.<ref name=""cia.gov""/>

With the discovery of diamonds and the increase in government revenue that this brought, there was a huge increase in educational provision in the country. All students were guaranteed ten years of basic education, leading to a Junior Certificate qualification. Approximately half of the school population attends a further two years of secondary schooling leading to the award of the Botswana General Certificate of Secondary Education (BGCSE). Secondary education in Botswana is neither free nor compulsory.

After leaving school, students can attend one of the seven technical colleges in the country, or take vocational training courses in [[teaching]] or [[nursing]]. Students enter the [[University of Botswana]], [[Botswana University of Agriculture and Natural Resources]], [[Botswana International University of Science and Technology]] and the [[Botswana Accountancy College]] in Gaborone. Many other students end up in the numerous private tertiary education colleges around the country. Notable among these is [https://web.archive.org/web/20130904150159/http://www.bothocollege.ac.bw/ Botho University], the country's first private university which offers undergraduate programs in Accounting, Business and Computing.

A vast majority of these students are government sponsored. The nation's second international university, the Botswana International University of Science and Technology, was completed in [[Palapye]] in 2011.

The quantitative gains have not always been matched by qualitative ones. Primary schools in particular still lack resources, and the teachers are less well paid than their secondary school colleagues.

Botswana is planning to use science and technology to diversify its economy and thereby reduce its dependence on diamond mining. To this end, the government has set up six hubs since 2008, in the agriculture, diamonds, innovation, transport, health and education sectors.<ref name="":0"" />

Botswana published its updated ''National Policy on Research, Science and Technology'' in 2011, within a UNESCO project sponsored by the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and Development (AECID). This policy aims to take up the challenges of rapid technological evolution, globalisation and the achievement of the national development goals formulated in high-level strategic documents that include Botswana's ''Tenth National Development Plan'' to 2016 and ''Vision 2016''.<ref name="":0"" />
The ''National Policy on Research, Science, Technology and Innovation'' (2011) fixes the target of raising gross domestic expenditure on research and development (R&D) from 0.26% of GDP in 2012 to over 2% of GDP by 2016. This target can only be reached within the specified time frame by raising public spending on R&D.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=546–547|access-date=20 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322210919/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|archive-date=22 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2016, the Botswana Institute of Technology Research and Innovation (BITRI) developed a rapid testing kit for [[foot-and-mouth disease]] in collaboration with the Botswana Vaccine Institute and [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]. The existing diagnostic methods required highly trained laboratory personnel and special equipment, which caused delays in the implementation of control procedures; whereas the kit developed in Botswana allows for on-site diagnosis to be made.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news.rapidmicromethods.com/2016/12/bitri-develops-rapid-foot-and-mouth.html?m=1 |title=BITRI Develops Rapid Foot and Mouth Disease Test Kit |website=rapidmicromethods.com |access-date=9 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110013809/http://news.rapidmicromethods.com/2016/12/bitri-develops-rapid-foot-and-mouth.html?m=1 |archive-date=10 January 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On 19 November 2021 scientists at the Botswana Harvard HIV Reference Laboratory (BHHRL) first discovered the variant Omicron subsequently designated B.1.1.529, and then named ""Omicron"" becoming the first country in the world to discover the variant. Since early 2021, they have genome-sequenced some 2,300 positive SARS-CoV-2 virus samples. According to Dr Gaseitsiwe, Botswana's genome sequence submissions to GISAID are among the highest in the African region on a per capita basis, on a par with its well-resourced neighbour South Africa. Botswana Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership (BHP) was built in 2003, two years after the umbrella organisation opened the BHHRL, its purpose-built HIV research lab and one of the first on the continent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2021/12/14/inside-the-botswana-lab-that-discovered-omicron |title=Inside the Botswana lab that discovered Omicron |work=Aljazeera |last=Flood |first=Zoe |date=14 December 2021 |access-date=9 January 2022 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211214111713/http://www.aljazeera.com/features/2021/12/14/inside-the-botswana-lab-that-discovered-omicron |archive-date=14 December 2021 }}</ref>

The largest [[ethnic group]] in Burkina Faso is the [[Mossi people]], who settled the area in the 11th and 13th centuries. They established powerful [[Mossi Kingdoms|kingdoms]] such as the Ouagadougou, Tenkodogo, and Yatenga. In 1896, it was [[colonize]]d by the [[French colonial empire|French]] as part of [[French West Africa]]; in 1958, Upper Volta became a [[self-governing colony]] within the [[French Community]]. In 1960, it gained full independence with [[Maurice Yaméogo]] as [[List of heads of state of Burkina Faso|president]]. Since it gained its independence, the country was subject to instability, [[Sahel drought|droughts]], famines and corruption. Various coups have also taken place in the country, in [[1966 Upper Voltan coup d'état|1966]], [[1980 Upper Voltan coup d'état|1980]], [[1982 Upper Voltan coup d'état|1982]], [[1983 Upper Voltan coup d'état|1983]], [[1987 Burkina Faso coup d'état|1987]], and twice in 2022, in [[January 2022 Burkina Faso coup d'état|January]] and [[September 2022 Burkina Faso coup d'état|September]], as well as [[1989 Burkina Faso coup d'état attempt|an attempt in 1989]] and another in [[2015 Burkina Faso coup d'état|2015]].

[[Thomas Sankara]] came to power following a successful coup in 1982. As president, Sankara embarked on a series of ambitious [[socioeconomic]] reforms which included a nationwide [[literacy]] campaign, [[land redistribution]] to [[peasant]]s, providing vaccinations to over 2 million children, railway and road construction, equalized access to education, and the outlawing of [[female genital mutilation]], [[forced marriage]]s, and [[polygamy]]. He served as the country's president until 1987 when he was deposed and assassinated in a coup led by [[Blaise Compaoré]], who became president and ruled the country until [[2014 Burkinabè uprising|his removal on 31 October 2014]]. 

Burkina Faso has been severely affected by the rise of [[Islamist terrorism in the Sahel]] since the mid-2010s. Several [[militia]]s, partly allied with the [[Islamic State]] (IS) or [[al-Qaeda]], [[Jihadist insurgency in Burkina Faso|operate in Burkina Faso]] and across the border in [[Mali]] and [[Niger]]. More than one million of the country's 21 million inhabitants are [[internally displaced person]]s. [[Burkina Faso Armed Forces|Burkina Faso's military]] seized power in a [[January 2022 Burkina Faso coup d'état|coup d'état on 23–24 January 2022]], overthrowing President [[Roch Marc Christian Kaboré|Roch Marc Kaboré]]. On 31 January, the military junta restored the constitution and appointed [[Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba]] as interim president, who was himself overthrown in a [[September 2022 Burkina Faso coup d'état|second coup on 30 September]] and replaced by military captain [[Ibrahim Traoré]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Burkina Faso restores constitution, names coup leader president|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/31/burkina-faso-restores-constitution-names-coup-leader-president|access-date=31 January 2022|website=www.aljazeera.com|language=en}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Formerly the [[Republic of Upper Volta]], the country was renamed ""Burkina Faso"" on 4 August 1984 by then-President Thomas Sankara. The words ""Burkina"" and ""Faso"" stem from different languages spoken in the country: ""Burkina"" comes from [[Mooré]] and means ""upright"", showing how the people are proud of their integrity, while ""Faso"" comes from the [[Dioula language]] (as written in [[N'Ko script|N'Ko]]: {{lang|dyu|ߝߊ߬ߛߏ߫}} ''faso'') and means ""fatherland"" (literally, ""father's house""). The ""-bè"" suffix added onto ""Burkina"" to form the demonym ""Burkinabè"" comes from the [[Fula language]] and means ""women or men"".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://afrolegends.com/2013/09/12/why-the-name-burkina-faso/ |title=Why the name: Burkina Faso? |work=afrolegends.com |date=12 September 2013}}</ref> The CIA summarizes the etymology as ""land of the honest (incorruptible) men"".<ref name=""auto1"">{{Cite CIA World Factbook|country=Burkina Faso|date=21 December 2018|access-date=16 January 2019|year=2018}}</ref>

The French colony of Upper Volta was named for its location on the upper courses of the [[Volta River]] (the [[Black Volta|Black]], [[Red Volta|Red]] and [[White Volta]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=by3eqBwNRyIC&pg=PA21|title=iAfrica – Ancient History UNTOLD|publisher=Forbidden Fruit Books LLC|page=21|language=en}}</ref>

Starting in the early 1890s during the European [[Scramble for Africa]], a series of European military officers made attempts to claim parts of what is today Burkina Faso. At times these [[Colonialism|colonialists]] and their armies fought the local peoples; at times they forged alliances with them and made treaties. The colonialist officers and their home governments also made treaties among themselves. The territory of Burkina Faso was invaded by [[French Third Republic|France]], becoming a [[French colonial empire|French protectorate]] in 1896.<ref>[[#Rupley|Rupley]], pp.&nbsp;30–33</ref>

[[File:French West Africa 1913 map.png|thumb|[[French West Africa]] c. 1913]]

The eastern and western regions, where a standoff against the forces of the powerful ruler [[Samori Ture]] complicated the situation, came under French occupation in 1897. By 1898, the majority of the territory corresponding to Burkina Faso was nominally conquered; however, French control of many parts remained uncertain.<ref name="":0""/>

The [[Anglo-French Convention of 1898|Franco-British Convention of 14 June 1898]] created the country's modern borders. In the French territory, a war of conquest against local communities and political powers continued for about five years. In 1904, the largely pacified territories of the [[Volta River|Volta basin]] were integrated into the [[Upper Senegal and Niger]] colony of [[French West Africa]] as part of the reorganization of the French West African colonial empire. The colony had its capital in [[Bamako]].

The language of colonial administration and schooling became French. The public education system started from humble origins. Advanced education was provided for many years during the colonial period in Dakar.

The indigenous population was highly discriminated against. For example, African children were not allowed to ride bicycles or pick fruit from trees, ""privileges"" reserved for the children of colonists. Violating these regulations could land parents in jail.<ref>Figures de la révolution africaine, de Kenyatta à Sankara, La Découverte, 2014, pp. 271–288.</ref>

[[Conscription|Draftees]] from the territory participated in the European fronts of [[World War I]] in the battalions of the [[Tirailleurs sénégalais|Senegalese Rifles]]. Between 1915 and 1916, the districts in the western part of what is now Burkina Faso and the bordering eastern fringe of Mali became the stage of one of the most important armed oppositions to colonial government: the [[Volta-Bani War]].<ref>Mahir Saul and Patrick Royer, ''West African Challenge to Empire'', 2001</ref>

The French government finally suppressed the movement but only after suffering defeats. It also had to organize its largest expeditionary force of its colonial history to send into the country to suppress the insurrection. Armed opposition wracked the Sahelian north when the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and allied groups of the Dori region ended their truce with the government.

[[File:Mittelholzer-ouagadougou.jpg|thumb|The capital, [[Ouagadougou]], in 1930]]

[[French Upper Volta]] was established on 1 March 1919. The French feared a recurrence of armed uprising and had related economic considerations. To bolster its administration, the colonial government separated the present territory of Burkina Faso from Upper Senegal and Niger.

The new colony was named ''Haute Volta'' for its location on the upper courses of the [[Volta River]] (the [[Black Volta|Black]], [[Red Volta|Red]] and [[White Volta]]), and François Charles Alexis Édouard Hesling became its first [[List of governors of Upper Volta|governor]]. Hesling initiated an ambitious road-making program to improve infrastructure and promoted the growth of cotton for export. The cotton policy – based on [[coercion]] – failed, and revenue generated by the colony stagnated. The colony was dismantled on 5 September 1932, being split between the French colonies of [[Ivory Coast]], [[French Sudan]] and [[Niger]]. Ivory Coast received the largest share, which contained most of the population as well as the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.

France reversed this change during the period of intense anti-colonial agitation that followed the end of [[World War II]]. On 4 September 1947, it revived the colony of Upper Volta, with its previous boundaries, as a part of the [[French Union]]. The French designated its colonies as departments of [[metropolitan France]] on the European continent.

On 11 December 1958 the colony achieved [[Self-governance|self-government]] as the [[Republic of Upper Volta]]; it joined the Franco-African Community. A revision in the organization of French Overseas Territories had begun with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of 23 July 1956. This act was followed by reorganization measures approved by the French parliament early in 1957 to ensure a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French community on 11 December 1958. Full independence from France was received in 1960.<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/635|title=More (Language of the Moose people) Phrase Book|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|access-date=16 February 2013}}</ref>

===Upper Volta (1958–1984)===
{{main|Republic of Upper Volta}}
[[File:Maurice Yaméogo and Louis Jacquinot exchanging instruments of ratification for the independence of the Upper Volta.jpg|thumb|[[Maurice Yaméogo]], the first president of Upper Volta, examines documents pertaining to the ratification of the country's independence in 1960]]

The Republic of Upper Volta ({{lang-fr|link=no|République de Haute-Volta}}) was established on 11 December 1958 as a [[self-governing colony]] within the [[French Community]]. The name ''Upper Volta'' related to the nation's location along the upper reaches of the [[Volta River]]. The river's three [[Tributary|tributaries]] are called the [[Black Volta|Black]], [[White Volta|White]] and [[Red Volta]]. These were expressed in the three colors of the [[Flag of Upper Volta|former national flag]].

Before attaining autonomy, it had been French Upper Volta and part of the French Union. On 5 August 1960, it attained full independence from [[French Fourth Republic|France]]. The first president, [[Maurice Yaméogo]], was the leader of the [[Voltaic Democratic Union]] (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by [[universal suffrage]] of a president and a national assembly for five-year terms. Soon after coming to power, Yaméogo banned all political parties other than the UDV. The government lasted until 1966. After much unrest, including mass demonstrations and strikes by students, labor unions, and civil servants, the military intervened.

==== Lamizana's rule and multiple coups ====

The [[1966 Upper Voltan coup d'état|1966 military coup]] deposed Yaméogo, suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lt. Col. [[Sangoulé Lamizana]] at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for four years. On 14 June 1976, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. Lamizana's rule coincided with the beginning of the [[Sahel drought]] and famine which had a devastating impact on Upper Volta and neighboring countries. After conflict over the 1976 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977. Lamizana was re-elected by open elections in 1978.

Lamizana's government faced problems with the country's traditionally powerful trade unions, and on 25 November 1980, Col. [[Saye Zerbo]] overthrew President Lamizana in a [[1980 Upper Voltan coup d'état|bloodless coup]]. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.

Colonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later by Maj. Dr. [[Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo]] and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP) in the [[1982 Upper Voltan coup d'état]]. The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqEHU3iW2i0C&pg=PA137 |title=Revolutionary Overthrow of Constitutional Orders in Africa |last=Anyangwe|first=Carlson|date=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-727-78-0|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Burkina Faso's history, also called Upper Volta, endured between 1960 and 1987, 6 military coups and the establishment of 3 republics.|url=https://www.blaisecompaore.com/en/political-and-military-career/1960-1983-engagement/|access-date=5 November 2020|website=Blaise Compaore |language=en-GB}}</ref>

====1983 coup d'état====

Infighting developed between the right and left factions of the CSP. The leader of the leftists, Capt. [[Thomas Sankara]], was appointed prime minister in January 1983, but was subsequently arrested. Efforts to free him, directed by Capt. [[Blaise Compaoré]], resulted in a military coup d'état on 4 August 1983.

The coup brought Sankara to power and his government began to implement a series of revolutionary programs which included mass-vaccinations, infrastructure improvements, the expansion of women's rights, encouragement of domestic agricultural consumption, and anti-desertification projects.<ref name=""UprightDVD"">''[[Thomas Sankara: the Upright Man]]'' by ''[[California Newsreel]]''</ref>

===Burkina Faso (since 1984)===
On 2 August 1984, on President Sankara's initiative, the country's name changed from ""Upper Volta"" to ""Burkina Faso"", or ''land of the honest men''; (the literal translation is ''land of the upright men''.)<ref>

The [[Pioneers of the Revolution]] youth programme was also established.

Sankara launched an ambitious socioeconomic programme for change, one of the largest ever undertaken on the African continent.<ref name=""UprightDVD"" /> His foreign policies centred on [[anti-imperialism]], with his government rejecting all [[foreign aid]], pushing for [[odious debt]] reduction, nationalising all land and mineral wealth and averting the power and influence of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]].

Sankara pushed for agrarian self-sufficiency and promoted public health by vaccinating 2,500,000 children against [[meningitis]], [[yellow fever]], and [[measles]].<ref name=""Grila2""/> His national agenda also included planting over 10,000,000 trees to halt the growing [[desertification]] of the [[Sahel]].

In the 1980s, when ecological awareness was still very low, Thomas Sankara was one of the few African leaders to consider environmental protection a priority. He engaged in three major battles: against bush fires ""which will be considered as crimes and will be punished as such""; against cattle roaming ""which infringes on the rights of peoples because unattended animals destroy nature""; and against the anarchic cutting of firewood ""whose profession will have to be organized and regulated"". As part of a development program involving a large part of the population, ten million trees were planted in Burkina Faso in fifteen months during the revolution. To face the advancing desert and recurrent droughts, Thomas Sankara also proposed the planting of wooded strips of about fifty kilometers, crossing the country from east to west. He then thought of extending this vegetation belt to other countries. Cereal production, close to 1.1 billion tons before 1983, was predicted to rise to 1.6 billion tons in 1987. Jean Ziegler, former UN special rapporteur for the right to food, said that the country ""had become food self-sufficient.""<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2020/01/03/thomas-sankara-l-ecologiste_6024742_3212.html |title=Thomas Sankara, l'écologiste |language=fr |first=Pierre |last=Lepidi |date=3 January 2020 |newspaper=[[Le Monde]] |location=Paris}}</ref>

In 2000, the constitution was amended to reduce the presidential term to five years and set term limits to two, preventing successive re-election. The amendment took effect during the 2005 elections. If passed beforehand, it would have prevented Compaoré from being reelected. Other presidential candidates challenged the election results. But in October 2005, the constitutional council ruled that, because Compaoré was the sitting president in 2000, the amendment would not apply to him until the end of his second term in office. This cleared the way for his candidacy in [[Burkina Faso presidential elections, 2005|the 2005 election]]. On 13 November 2005, Compaoré was reelected in a landslide, because of a divided political opposition.

In the [[2010 Burkinabé presidential election|2010 presidential election]], President Compaoré was re-elected. Only 1.6&nbsp;million Burkinabè voted, out of a total population 10&nbsp;times that size.

==Government==
{{main|Politics of Burkina Faso}}
[[File:Blaise Compaoré 2014 White House.png|thumb|upright|President Blaise Compaoré ruled Burkina Faso from a coup d'état in 1987 until he lost power in 2014.]]
[[File:Assemblee Nationale Burkina Faso.jpg|thumb|The [[National Assembly of Burkina Faso|National Assembly]] building in downtown [[Ouagadougou]]]]
The [[Constitution of Burkina Faso|constitution]] of 2 June 1991 established a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential government]]: its parliament could be dissolved by the [[List of heads of state of Burkina Faso|President of the Republic]], who was to be [[Elections in Burkina Faso|elected]] for a term of seven years. In 2000, the constitution was amended to reduce the presidential term to five years and set term limits to two, preventing successive re-election. The amendment took effect during the 2005 elections.

The parliament consisted of [[unicameralism|one chamber]] known as the [[National Assembly (Burkina Faso)|National Assembly]], which had 111&nbsp;seats with members elected to serve five-year terms. There was also a constitutional chamber, composed of ten members, and an economic and social council whose roles were purely consultative. The 1991 constitution created a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament, but the upper house (Chamber of Representatives) was abolished in 2002.

The Compaoré administration had worked to [[Decentralization#Government decentralization|decentralize power]] by devolving some of its powers to regions and municipal authorities. But the widespread distrust of politicians and lack of political involvement by many residents complicated this process. Critics described this as a hybrid decentralisation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Failure Likely|author=Tiendrebeongo, Aristide|publisher=dandc.eu|date=March 2013|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/decentralisation-burkina-faso-coming-against-obstacles-because-local-people-are-distrustful}}</ref>

[[Political freedom]]s are severely restricted in Burkina Faso. [[Political freedom|Human rights organizations]] had criticised the Compaoré administration for numerous acts of state-sponsored violence against journalists and other politically active members of society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/talktojazeera/2017/01/africa-human-rights-court-limits-justice-170107092107153.html|title=Africa's human rights court and the limits of justice|publisher=Al Jazeera|access-date=27 October 2017|archive-date=27 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027232853/http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/talktojazeera/2017/01/africa-human-rights-court-limits-justice-170107092107153.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/252867.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/252867.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|title=Burkina Faso 2015 Human Rights Report|access-date=3 June 2018|year=2015|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]}}</ref>

The prime minister is head of government and is appointed by the president with the approval of the National Assembly. He is responsible for recommending a cabinet for appointment by the president.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/burkina-faso| title=Burkina Faso| date=4 January 2018| access-date=6 January 2019| archive-date=7 January 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107072317/https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/burkina-faso}}</ref>

=== Constitution ===
{{Further|Constitution of Burkina Faso}}

In 2015, Kaboré promised to revise the 1991 constitution. The revision was completed in 2018. One condition prevents any individual from serving as president for more than ten years either consecutively or intermittently and provides a method for impeaching a president. A referendum on the constitution for the Fifth Republic was scheduled for 24 March 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apanews.net/en/news/burkina-faso-referendum-new-constitutional-set-for-march-2019|website=Danube Travel|date=28 August 2018|title=Burkina Faso: Referendum on new constitution set for March 2019|access-date=6 January 2019|archive-date=7 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107015849/http://apanews.net/en/news/burkina-faso-referendum-new-constitutional-set-for-march-2019}}</ref>

Certain rights are also enshrined in the revised wording: access to drinking water, access to decent housing and a recognition of the right to civil disobedience, for example. The referendum was required because the opposition parties in Parliament refused to sanction the proposed text.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20180827-burkina-faso-le-referendum-constitutionnel-prevu-le-24-mars-2019 | title=Burkina Faso: Le référendum constitutionnel prévu le 24 mars 2019 – Radio France Internationale| date=27 August 2018}}</ref>

===Foreign relations===
{{Further|Foreign relations of Burkina Faso}}

Burkina Faso is a member of the [[G5 Sahel]], [[Community of Sahel–Saharan States]], [[La Francophonie]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], and United Nations. It is currently suspended from [[ECOWAS]] and the [[African Union]].

===Military===
{{main|Military of Burkina Faso}}

The [[Army of Burkina Faso|army]] consists of some 6,000&nbsp;men in voluntary service, augmented by a part-time national People's Militia composed of civilians between 25 and 35&nbsp;years of age who are trained in both military and civil duties. According to ''Jane's Sentinel Country Risk Assessment'', Burkina Faso's Army is undermanned for its force structure and poorly equipped, but has wheeled light-armour vehicles, and may have developed useful combat expertise through interventions in Liberia and elsewhere in Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Online|first=Peace FM|title=Coup Underway In Burkina Faso, President Detained By Military|url=https://www.peacefmonline.com/pages/politics/politics/202201/459323.php|access-date=24 January 2022|website=Peacefmonline.com - Ghana news}}</ref>

In terms of training and equipment, the regular Army is believed to be neglected in relation to the élite Regiment of Presidential Security ({{lang-fr|link=no|Régiment de la Sécurité Présidentielle}} – RSP). Reports have emerged in recent years of disputes over pay and conditions.<ref>''[https://web.archive.org/web/20100827071950/http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Sentinel-Security-Assessment-West-Africa/Army-Burkina-Faso.html Jane's Sentinel Security Assessment – West Africa]'', 15 April 2009</ref> There is an air force with some 19&nbsp;operational aircraft, but no navy, as the country is landlocked. Military expenses constitute approximately 1.2% of the nation's GDP.

===Law enforcement===
{{main|Law enforcement in Burkina Faso}}
Burkina Faso employs numerous police and security forces, generally modeled after organizations used by [[French police]]. France continues to provide significant support and training to police forces. The ''Gendarmerie Nationale'' is organized along military lines, with most police services delivered at the brigade level. The [[Gendarmerie]] operates under the authority of the Minister of Defence, and its members are employed chiefly in the rural areas and along borders.<ref name=""Das, pp.&nbsp;139–141"">Das, Dilip K. and Palmiotto, Michael J. (2005) ''World Police Encyclopedia'', Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-94250-0}}. pp.&nbsp;139–141</ref>

There is a municipal police force controlled by the [[Ministry of Territorial Administration]]; a national police force controlled by the Ministry of Security; and an autonomous [[Regiment of Presidential Security]] (''Régiment de la Sécurité Présidentielle'', or RSP), a 'palace guard' devoted to the protection of the President of the Republic. Both the gendarmerie and the national police are subdivided into both administrative and judicial police functions; the former are detailed to protect public order and provide security, the latter are charged with criminal investigations.<ref name=""Das, pp.&nbsp;139–141""/>

All foreigners and citizens are required to carry photo ID passports, or other forms of identification or risk a fine, and police spot identity checks are commonplace for persons traveling by auto, [[Share taxi|bush-taxi]], or bus.<ref>U.S. Dept. of State, [https://web.archive.org/web/20131114034455/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1075.html Burkina Faso: Country Specific Information]</ref><ref>Foreign and Commonwealth Office,{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travelling-and-living-overseas/travel-advice-by-country/sub-saharan-africa/burkina-faso|title=Sub-Saharan Africa: Burkina Faso|access-date=13 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827125629/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travelling-and-living-overseas/travel-advice-by-country/sub-saharan-africa/burkina-faso|archive-date=27 August 2009 }} .

===Administrative divisions===
{{main|Regions of Burkina Faso|Provinces of Burkina Faso|Departments of Burkina Faso}}
The country is divided into [[Regions of Burkina Faso|13&nbsp;administrative regions]]. These regions encompass [[Provinces of Burkina Faso|45&nbsp;provinces]] and [[Departments of Burkina Faso|301&nbsp;departments]]. Each region is administered by a governor.

==Geography==
[[File:Burkina sat.png|thumb|Satellite image of Burkina Faso]]
{{main|Geography of Burkina Faso}}

[[File:Burkina Faso Map.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|Map of Burkina Faso]]
Burkina Faso lies mostly between latitudes [[9th parallel north|9°]] and [[15th parallel north|15°&nbsp;N]] (a small area is north of 15°), and longitudes [[6th meridian west|6°&nbsp;W]] and [[3rd meridian east|3°&nbsp;E]].

It is made up of two major types of countryside. The larger part of the country is covered by a [[peneplain]], which forms a gently undulating landscape with, in some areas, a few isolated hills, the last vestiges of a [[Precambrian]] [[massif]]. The southwest of the country, on the other hand, forms a [[sandstone]] massif, where the highest peak, [[Ténakourou]], is found at an elevation of {{convert|749|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. The massif is bordered by sheer cliffs up to {{convert|150|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} high. The average altitude of Burkina Faso is {{convert|400|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than {{convert|600|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}. Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country.

The country owes its former name of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it: the [[Black Volta]] (or ''Mouhoun''), the [[White Volta]] (''Nakambé'') and the [[Red Volta]] (''Nazinon''). The Black Volta is one of the country's only two rivers which flow year-round, the other being the [[Komoé River|Komoé]], which flows to the southwest. The basin of the [[Niger River]] also [[drainage basin|drains]] 27% of the country's surface.

The Niger's [[tributary|tributaries]] – the Béli, Gorouol, Goudébo, and Dargol – are [[Torrent (stream)|seasonal streams]] and flow for only four to six months a year. They still can flood and overflow, however. The country also contains numerous lakes – the principal ones are Tingrela, [[Lake Bam|Bam]], and Dem. The country contains large ponds, as well, such as Oursi, Béli, Yomboli, and Markoye. [[Drought|Water shortages]] are often a problem, especially in the north of the country.

===Climate===
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map BFA present.svg|thumb|Map of [[Köppen climate classification]]]]

Burkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two very distinct seasons. In the rainy season, the country receives between {{convert|600|and|900|mm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} of rainfall; in the dry season, the [[harmattan]] – a hot dry wind from the Sahara – blows. The rainy season lasts approximately four months, May/June to September, and is shorter in the north of the country. Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the Sudan-Guinea. The [[Sahel]] in the north typically receives less than {{convert|600|mm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}}<ref name=relationship>{{cite web|url=http://www.sim.org/country.asp?fun=1&CID=18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309142111/http://www.sim.org/country.asp?CID=18&fun=1|archive-date=9 March 2008|title=SIM Country Profile: Burkina Faso|access-date=5 August 2006}}</ref> of rainfall per&nbsp;year and has high temperatures, {{convert|5|–|47|°C|°F|0|lk=on}}.

A relatively dry [[tropical savanna]], the Sahel extends beyond the borders of Burkina Faso, from the [[Horn of Africa]] to the Atlantic Ocean, and borders the [[Sahara]] to its north and the fertile region of the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] to the south. Situated between 11° 3′ and 13° 5′ north [[latitude]], the Sudan-Sahel region is a transitional zone with regards to rainfall and temperature. Further to the south, the Sudan-Guinea zone receives more than {{convert|900|mm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}}<ref name=relationship/> of rain each year and has cooler average temperatures.

Burkina Faso has a larger number of [[elephant]]s than many countries in West Africa. Lions, leopards and buffalo can also be found here, including the dwarf or red buffalo, a smaller reddish-brown animal which looks like a fierce kind of short-legged cow. Other large predators live in Burkina Faso, such as the cheetah, the caracal or African lynx, the spotted hyena and the African wild dog, one of the continent's most endangered species.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.our-africa.org/burkina-faso/geography-wildlife?ref=nf |title=Geography & Wildlife |work=www.our-africa.org |access-date=15 October 2014 |archive-date=3 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903210757/http://www.our-africa.org/burkina-faso/geography-wildlife?ref=nf }}. our-africa.org</ref>

It consists mostly of rearing livestock. Especially in the south and southwest, the people grow crops of [[sorghum]], [[pearl millet]], maize (corn), peanuts, rice and cotton, with surpluses to be sold. A large part of the economic activity of the country is funded by international aid, despite having gold ores in abundance.

The top five export commodities in 2017 were, in order of importance: gems and precious metals, US$1.9&nbsp;billion (78.5% of total exports), cotton, $198.7&nbsp;million (8.3%), ores, slag, ash, $137.6&nbsp;million (5.8%), fruits, nuts: $76.6&nbsp;million (3.2%) and oil seeds: $59.5&nbsp;million (2.5%).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.worldstopexports.com/burkina-fasos-top-10-exports/ | title=Burkina Faso's Top 10 Exports| date=17 January 2019}}</ref>

A December 2018 report from the World Bank indicates that in 2017, economic growth increased to 6.4% in 2017 (vs. 5.9% in 2016) primarily due to gold production and increased investment in infrastructure. The increase in consumption linked to growth of the wage bill also supported economic growth. Inflation remained low, 0.4% that year but the public deficit grew to 7.7% of GDP (vs. 3.5% in 2016). The government was continuing to get financial aid and loans to finance the debt. To finance the public deficit, the Government combined concessional aid and borrowing on the regional market. The World Bank said that the economic outlook remained favorable in the short and medium term, although that could be negatively impacted. Risks included high oil prices (imports), lower prices of gold and cotton (exports) as well as terrorist threat and labour strikes.<ref name=""auto2"">{{cite web |url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/burkinafaso/overview|website=Danube Travel|date=26 November 2017|title=Burkina Faso |access-date=6 January 2019}}</ref>

Burkina Faso is part of the [[West African Monetary and Economic Union]] (UMEOA) and has adopted the [[West African CFA franc|CFA franc]]. This is issued by the [[Central Bank of the West African States]] (BCEAO), situated in [[Dakar]], Senegal. The BCEAO manages the monetary and reserve policy of the member states, and provides regulation and oversight of financial sector and banking activity. A legal framework regarding licensing, bank activities, organizational and capital requirements, inspections and sanctions (all applicable to all countries of the Union) is in place, having been reformed significantly in 1999. [[Microfinance]] institutions are governed by a separate law, which regulates microfinance activities in all WAEMU countries.

In 2018, tourism was almost non-existent in large parts of the country. The U.S. government (and others) warn their citizens not to travel into large parts of Burkina Faso: ""The northern Sahel border region shared with Mali and Niger due to crime and terrorism.

The 2018 CIA World Factbook provides this updated summary. ""Burkina Faso is a poor, landlocked country that depends on adequate rainfall. Irregular patterns of rainfall, poor soil, and the lack of adequate communications and other infrastructure contribute to the economy's vulnerability to external shocks. About 80% of the population is engaged in subsistence farming and cotton is the main cash crop. The country has few natural resources and a weak industrial base. Cotton and gold are Burkina Faso's key exports ...The country has seen an upswing in gold exploration, production, and exports.

While the end of the political crisis has allowed Burkina Faso's economy to resume positive growth, the country's fragile security situation could put these gains at risk. Political insecurity in neighboring Mali, unreliable energy supplies, and poor transportation links pose long-term challenges."" The report also highlights the 2018–2020 International Monetary Fund program, including the government's plan to ""reduce the budget deficit and preserve critical spending on social services and priority public investments"".<ref name=""auto1""/>

A 2018 report by the African Development Bank Group discussed a macroeconomic evolution: ""higher investment and continued spending on social services and security that will add to the budget deficit"". This group's prediction for 2018 indicated that the budget deficit would be reduced to 4.8% of GDP in 2018 and to 2.9% in 2019. Public debt associated with the National Economic and Social Development Plan was estimated at 36.9% of GDP in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.afdb.org/en/countries/west-africa/burkina-faso/burkina-faso-economic-outlook/ | title=Burkina Faso Economic Outlook| date=27 March 2019}}</ref>

===Approaches to improving food security===

====World Food Programme====
The United Nations' [[World Food Programme]] has worked on programs that are geared towards increasing food security in Burkina Faso.
The Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation&nbsp;200509 (PRRO) was formed to respond to the high levels of malnutrition in Burkina Faso, following the food and nutrition crisis in 2012.<ref name=""World Food Programme"">{{Cite web|title = Burkina Faso {{!}} WFP {{!}} United Nations World Food Programme – Fighting Hunger Worldwide|url = https://www.wfp.org/countries/burkina-faso/overview|website = wfp.org|access-date = 19 October 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150910072256/http://www.wfp.org/countries/burkina-faso/overview|archive-date = 10 September 2015}}</ref> The efforts of this project are mostly geared towards the treatment and prevention of malnutrition and include take home rations for the caretakers of those children who are being treated for malnutrition.<ref name=""World Food Programme""/> Additionally, the activities of this operation contribute to families' abilities to withstand future food crises. Better nutrition among the two most vulnerable groups, young children and pregnant women, prepares them to be able to respond better in times when food security is compromised, such as in droughts.<ref name=""World Food Programme""/>

The Country Programme (CP) has two parts: food and nutritional assistance to people with HIV/AIDS, and a school feeding program for all primary schools in the Sahel region.<ref name=""Brief"">{{Cite web|url = http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/ep/wfp272247.pdf|title = Burkina Faso Brief|publisher = World Food Programme}}</ref> The HIV/AIDS nutrition program aims to better the nutritional recovery of those who are living with HIV/AIDS and to protect at-risk children and orphans from malnutrition and food security.<ref name=""Brief""/> As part of the school feeding component, the Country Programme's goals are to increase enrollment and attendance in schools in the Sahel region, where enrollment rates are below the national average.<ref name=""World Food Programme""/> Furthermore, the program aims at improving gender parity rates in these schools, by providing girls with high attendance in the last two years of primary school with take-home rations of cereals as an incentive to households, encouraging them to send their girls to school.<ref name=""World Food Programme""/>

The WFP concluded the formation of a subsequently approved plan in August 2018 ""to support the Government's vision of 'a democratic, unified and united nation, transforming the structure of its economy and achieving a strong and inclusive growth through patterns of sustainable consumption and production.' It will take important steps in WFP's new strategic direction for strengthened national and local capacities to enable the Government and communities to own, manage, and implement food and nutrition security programmes by 2030"".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www1.wfp.org/operations/bf01-burkina-faso-transitional-icsp-january-december-2018 | title=Burkina Faso Transitional ICSP (January – December 2018) &#124; World Food Programme |work=www1.wfp.org}}</ref>

Its goal is to reinforce the capacities of service providers and institutions who are specifically involved in project implementation.<ref name=""AgProdFSP""/> The project's activities aim to build capacities of service providers, strengthen the capacity of food producer organizations, strengthen agricultural input supply delivery methods, and manage and evaluate project activities.<ref name=""AgProdFSP""/>

The December 2018 report by the World Bank indicated that the poverty rate fell slightly between 2009 and 2014, from 46% to a still high 40.1%. The report provided this updated summary of the country's development challenges: ""Burkina Faso remains vulnerable to climatic shocks related to changes in rainfall patterns and to fluctuations in the prices of its export commodities on world markets. Its economic and social development will, to some extent, be contingent on political stability in the country and the subregion, its openness to international trade, and export diversification"".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/burkinafaso/overview | title=Overview |work=www.worldbank.org}}</ref>

Since 2000, nearly 2&nbsp;million more people have access to water in the four principal urban centres in the country; the company has kept the quality of [[Water infrastructure|infrastructure]] high (less than 18% of the water is lost through leaks – one of the lowest in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]), improved financial reporting, and increased its annual revenue by an average of 12% (well above inflation).<ref name=ODI1/> Challenges remain, including difficulties among some customers in paying for services, with the need to rely on international aid to expand its infrastructure.<ref name=ODI1/> The state-owned, commercially run venture has helped the nation reach its [[Millennium Development Goal]] (MDG) targets in water-related areas, and has grown as a viable company.<ref name=ODI1/>

However, access to drinking water has improved over the last 28 years. According to UNICEF, access to drinking water has increased from 39 to 76% in rural areas between 1990 and 2015. In this same time span, access to drinking water increased from 75 to 97% in urban areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/bfa/english/bfa_wsh_programme-overview2016.pdf|website=UNICEF|access-date=1 May 2018|title=Burkina Faso: Programme Overview: Water, Sanitation & Hygiene (WASH)|archive-date=3 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503041104/https://www.unicef.org/bfa/english/bfa_wsh_programme-overview2016.pdf}}</ref>

{{main|Transport in Burkina Faso}}
Transport in Burkina Faso is limited by relatively underdeveloped infrastructure.

As of June 2014 the main international airport, [[Ouagadougou Airport]], had regularly scheduled flights to many destinations in West Africa as well as Paris, [[Brussels]] and [[Istanbul]]. The other international airport, [[Bobo Dioulasso Airport]], has flights to Ouagadougou and [[Port Bouet Airport|Abidjan]].

[[Rail transport in Burkina Faso]] consists of a single line which runs from [[Kaya, Burkina Faso|Kaya]] to [[Abidjan]] in Ivory Coast via [[Ouagadougou]], [[Koudougou]], Bobo Dioulasso and [[Banfora]]. ''Sitarail'' operates a passenger train three times a week along the route.<ref>European Rail Timetable, Summer&nbsp;2014 Edition</ref>

==Science and technology==
{{Main|Science and technology in Burkina Faso}}

In 2009, Burkina Faso spent 0.20% of GDP on research and development (R&D), one of the lowest ratios in West Africa. There were 48 researchers (in full-time equivalents) per million inhabitants in 2010, which is more than twice the average for sub-Saharan Africa (20 per million population in 2013) and higher than the ratio for [[Ghana]] and [[Nigeria]] (39). It is, however, much lower than the ratio for [[Senegal]] (361 per million inhabitants). In Burkina Faso in 2010, 46% of researchers were working in the health sector, 16% in engineering, 13% in natural sciences, 9% in agricultural sciences, 7% in the humanities and 4% in social sciences.<ref name=""UNESCO Science Report"">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|pages=472–497}}</ref> Burkina Faso was ranked 124th in the [[Global Innovation Index]] in 2023.<ref>{{Cite book |last=WIPO |title=Global Innovation Index 2023, 15th Edition |url=https://www.wipo.int/global_innovation_index/en/2023/index.html |access-date=2023-10-30 |website=www.wipo.int |date=30 October 2023 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization |doi=10.34667/tind.46596 |isbn=9789280534320 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=28 October 2013|title=Global Innovation Index|url=https://knowledge.insead.edu/entrepreneurship-innovation/global-innovation-index-2930|access-date=2 September 2021|website=INSEAD Knowledge|language=en|archive-date=2 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210902101622/https://knowledge.insead.edu/entrepreneurship-innovation/global-innovation-index-2930}}</ref>

In January 2011, the government created the Ministry of Scientific Research and Innovation. Up until then, management of science, technology and innovation had fallen under the Department of Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research. Within this ministry, the Directorate General for Research and Sector Statistics is responsible for planning. A separate body, the Directorate General of Scientific Research, Technology and Innovation, co-ordinates research. This is a departure from the pattern in many other West African countries where a single body fulfils both functions. The move signals the government's intention to make science and technology a development priority.<ref name=""UNESCO Science Report"" />

In 2012, Burkina Faso adopted a ''National Policy for Scientific and Technical Research'', the strategic objectives of which are to develop R&D and the application and commercialization of research results. The policy also makes provisions for strengthening the ministry's strategic and operational capacities. One of the key priorities is to improve food security and self-sufficiency by boosting capacity in agricultural and environmental sciences. The creation of a centre of excellence in 2014 at the International Institute of Water and Environmental Engineering in Ouagadougou within the World Bank project provides essential funding for capacity-building in these priority areas.<ref name=""UNESCO Science Report"" />

A dual priority is to promote innovative, effective and accessible health systems. The government wishes to develop, in parallel, applied sciences and technology and social and human sciences. To complement the national research policy, the government has prepared a ''National Strategy to Popularize Technologies, Inventions and Innovations'' (2012) and a ''National Innovation Strategy'' (2014). Other policies also incorporate science and technology, such as that on ''Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research'' (2010), the ''National Policy on Food and Nutrition Security'' (2014) and the ''National Programme for the Rural Sector'' (2011).<ref name=""UNESCO Science Report"" />

In 2013, Burkina Faso passed the Science, Technology and Innovation Act establishing three mechanisms for financing research and innovation, a clear indication of high-level commitment. These mechanisms are the National Fund for Education and Research, the National Fund for Research and Innovation for Development and the Forum of Scientific Research and Technological Innovation.<ref name=""UNESCO Science Report"" />

Burkina Faso is an ethnically integrated, secular state where most people are concentrated in the south and centre, where their density sometimes exceeds {{convert|48|PD/km2}}. Hundreds of thousands of Burkinabè migrate regularly to Ivory Coast and Ghana, mainly for seasonal agricultural work. These flows of workers are affected by external events; the September 2002 coup attempt in Ivory Coast and the ensuing fighting meant that hundreds of thousands of Burkinabè returned to Burkina Faso. The regional economy suffered when they were unable to work.<ref name=bn/>

In 2015, most of the population belonged to ""one of two West African ethnic cultural groups: the Voltaic and the Mandé. Voltaic Mossi make up about 50% of the population and are descended from warriors who moved to the area from Ghana around 1100, establishing an empire that lasted over 800 years"".<ref name=""worldpopulationreview.com""/>

===Ethnic groups===
{{Main|Ethnic groups in Burkina Faso}}
Burkina Faso's 17.3 million people belong to two major West African ethnic cultural groups: the [[Gur languages|Voltaic]] and the [[Mandé peoples|Mandé]] (whose common language is [[Dioula language|Dioula]]). The Voltaic [[Mossi people|Mossi]] make up about one-half of the population. The Mossi claim descent from warriors who migrated to present-day Burkina Faso from [[Northern Region (Ghana)|northern Ghana]] around 1100&nbsp;AD. They established an empire that lasted more than 800&nbsp;years. Predominantly farmers, the Mossi kingdom is led by the ''[[Mogho Naba]],'' whose court is in Ouagadougou.<ref name=""bn"">{{citation-attribution|1=[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2834.htm ""Burkina Faso""], U.S. Department of State, June 2008.}}</ref>

Education in Burkina Faso is divided into primary, secondary and higher education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Burkina-Faso-EDUCATION.html|title=Education – Burkina Faso|publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com|access-date=1 October 2009}}</ref> High school costs approximately CFA&nbsp;25,000 (US$50) per year, which is far above the means of most Burkinabè families. Boys receive preference in schooling; as such, girls' education and literacy rates are far lower than their male counterparts. An increase in girls' schooling has been observed because of the government's policy of making school cheaper for girls and granting them more scholarships.

To proceed from primary to middle school, middle to high school or high school to college, national exams must be passed. Institutions of higher education include the [[University of Ouagadougou]], [[The Polytechnic University of Bobo-Dioulasso]], and the [[University of Koudougou]], which is also a teacher training institution. There are some small private colleges in the capital city of [[Ouagadougou]] but these are affordable to only a small portion of the population.

There is also the [[International School of Ouagadougou]] (ISO), an American-based private school located in Ouagadougou.

In 1934, during French occupation, Dim-Dolobsom Ouedraogo published his ''Maximes, pensées et devinettes mossi'' (''Maxims, Thoughts and Riddles of the Mossi''), a record of the oral history of the [[Mossi people]].<ref name=""KS"">{{cite book|last=Salhi|first=Kamal|title=Francophone Voices|publisher=Intellect Books|year=1999|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9u9TeDegXMC|isbn=978-1-902454-03-0|access-date=26 April 2014}}</ref>

The oral tradition continued to have an influence on Burkinabè writers in the post-independence Burkina Faso of the 1960s, such as [[Nazi Boni]] and Roger Nikiema.<ref name=""TJA"">{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Tuzyline Jita|title=Women's Studies Quarterly: Teaching African Literatures in a Global Literary|publisher=[[Feminist Press]]|year=1997|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QD8TgZVWugYC|isbn=978-1-55861-169-6|access-date=26 April 2014}}</ref> The 1960s saw a growth in the number of playwrights being published.<ref name=""KS""/> Since the 1970s, literature has developed in Burkina Faso with many more writers being published.<ref name=""JM"">{{cite book|last=Marchais|first=Julien|title=Burkina Faso|publisher=Petit Futé|pages=91–92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6jsBLSzJWYsC|language=fr|isbn=978-2-7469-1601-2|year=2006|access-date=26 April 2014}}</ref>

The [[theatre of Burkina Faso]] combines traditional Burkinabè performance with the colonial influences and post-colonial efforts to educate rural people to produce a distinctive national theatre. Traditional ritual ceremonies of the many ethnic groups in Burkina Faso have long involved dancing with [[mask]]s. Western-style theatre became common during colonial times, heavily influenced by [[French theatre]]. With independence came a new style of theatre inspired by [[Theatre of the Oppressed|forum theatre]] aimed at educating and entertaining Burkina Faso's rural people.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}}

In addition to several rich traditional artistic heritages among the peoples, there is a large artist community in Burkina Faso, especially in [[Ouagadougou]]. Much of the crafts produced are for the country's growing tourist industry.

Burkina Faso also hosts the International Art and Craft Fair, Ouagadougou. It is better known by its French name as [[SIAO]], ''Le Salon International de l' Artisanat de Ouagadougou'', and is one of the most important African handicraft fairs.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Cuisine of Burkina Faso}}
[[File:Fufu.jpg|thumb|A plate of [[fufu]] (right) accompanied with [[peanut soup]]]]

Typical of West African cuisine, Burkina Faso's cuisine is based on [[staple food]]s of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], rice, maize, peanuts, potatoes, [[bean]]s, [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]s and [[okra]].<ref name=""ox"">{{cite web|title=Oxfam's Cool Planet – Food in Burkina Faso|publisher=[[Oxfam]]|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet/ontheline/explore/journey/burkina/food.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517115414/http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet/ontheline/explore/journey/burkina/food.htm|archive-date=17 May 2012|access-date=21 May 2008}}</ref> The most common sources of animal protein are chicken, chicken eggs and freshwater fish. A typical Burkinabè beverage is Banji or Palm Wine, which is fermented [[Palm wine|palm sap]]; and Zoom-kom, or ""grain water"" purportedly the national drink of Burkina Faso. Zoom-kom is milky-looking and whitish, having a water and cereal base, best drunk with ice cubes. In the more rural regions, in the outskirts of Burkina, you would find Dolo, which is drink made from fermented millet.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://sinotables.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1217:lhumeur-de-dom-zoom-kom-la-boisson-star-des-burkinabes&catid=48:encontinu-secondtwo-droite| title = article in French on Burkinabe Zoom-kom}}</ref>

===Cinema===
{{main|Cinema of Burkina Faso}}
The [[cinema of Burkina Faso]] is an important part of the West African film industry and African film as a whole.<ref>Spaas, Lieve (2000) ""Burkina Faso,"" in ''The Francophone Film: A Struggle for Identity,'' pp.&nbsp;232–246. Manchester: Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0-7190-5861-9}}.</ref> Burkina's contribution to [[African cinema]] started with the establishment of the film festival [[FESPACO]] (Festival Panafricain du Cinéma et de la Télévision de Ouagadougou), which was launched as a film week in 1969. Many of the nation's filmmakers are known internationally and have won international prizes.

For many years the headquarters of the Federation of Panafrican Filmmakers (FEPACI) was in Ouagadougou, rescued in 1983 from a period of moribund inactivity by the enthusiastic support and funding of President Sankara. (In 2006 the Secretariat of FEPACI moved to South Africa, but the headquarters of the organization is still in Ouagadougou.) Among the best known directors from Burkina Faso are [[Gaston Kaboré]], [[Idrissa Ouedraogo]] and [[Dani Kouyate]].<ref>Turégano, Teresa Hoefert (2005) ''African Cinema and Europe: Close-Up on Burkina Faso'', Florence: European Press Academic, {{ISBN|88-8398-031-X}}.</ref> Burkina produces popular television series such as ''Les Bobodiouf''. Internationally known filmmakers such as Ouedraogo, Kabore, Yameogo, and Kouyate make popular television series.

===Sports===

{{main|Sport in Burkina Faso}}
Sport in Burkina Faso is widespread and includes football, basketball, cycling, rugby union, handball, tennis, boxing and martial arts. Football is the most popular sport in Burkina Faso, played both professionally, and informally in towns and villages across the country. The national team is nicknamed ""Les Etalons"" (""the Stallions"") in reference to the legendary horse of Princess [[Yennenga]].

In 1998, Burkina Faso hosted the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] for which the Omnisport Stadium in Bobo-Dioulasso was built. Burkina Faso qualified for the [[2013 Africa Cup of Nations|2013 African Cup of Nations]] in South Africa and reached the final, but then lost to Nigeria 0–1. The country has never qualified for a [[FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007050949/http://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/index.html|archive-date=7 October 2011|access-date=4 February 2017|title=The FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking|publisher=FIFA}}</ref>

Basketball is another sport which enjoys much popularity for both men and women.<ref>{{cite book|last=Keim|first=Marion|title=Sport and Development Policy in Africa – Results of collaborative study of selected country cases|publisher=SUN PRESS|date= 2014|orig-date=1st pub. 2014|page=206|chapter=COUNTRY PROFILE OF SPORT AND DEVELOPMENT – Sport and Popularity|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jsrAwAAQBAJ&q=burkina+faso+most+popular+sport&pg=PA57|isbn=978-1-920689-20-9}}</ref> The country's [[Burkina Faso national basketball team|men's national team]] had its most successful year in 2013 when it qualified for the [[AfroBasket]], the continent's prime basketball event.

===Music===

{{main|Music of Burkina Faso}}The '''music of Burkina Faso''' includes the [[folk music]] of 60 different [[ethnic group]]s. The [[Mossi people]], centrally located around the capital, [[Ouagadougou]], account for 40% of the population while, to the south, [[Gurunsi people|Gurunsi]], [[Gurma people|Gurma]], [[Dagaaba people|Dagaaba]] and [[Lobi people|Lobi]] populations, speaking [[Gur languages]] closely related to the [[Mossi language]], extend into the coastal states. In the north and east the [[Fulani]] of the [[Sahel]] preponderate, while in the south and west the [[Mande languages]] are common; [[Samo language (Burkina)|Samo]], [[Bissa people|Bissa]], [[Bobo people|Bobo]], [[Senufo people|Senufo]] and [[Marka people|Marka]]. Burkinabé traditional music has continued to thrive and musical output remains quite diverse. Popular music is mostly in French: Burkina Faso has yet to produce a major pan-African success.

===Media===
[[File:Burkina Faso media 2010.jpg|thumb|A cameraman in [[Ouagadougou]], Burkina Faso in 2010]]
{{main|Media of Burkina Faso|Communications in Burkina Faso}}

The nation's principal media outlet is its state-sponsored combined television and radio service, ''Radiodiffusion-Télévision Burkina'' (RTB).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtb.bf/|title=Radiodiffusion-Télévision Burkina|publisher=Rtb.bf|access-date=1 October 2009}}</ref> ''RTB'' broadcasts on two [[medium-wave]] ([[Amplitude modulation|AM]]) and several [[Frequency modulation|FM]] frequencies. Besides RTB, there are privately owned sports, cultural, music, and religious FM radio stations. ''RTB'' maintains a worldwide short-wave news broadcast (''Radio Nationale Burkina'') in the French language from the capital at Ouagadougou using a 100&nbsp;kW transmitter on 4.815 and 5.030&nbsp;MHz.<ref>Radio Station World, ''[http://radiostationworld.com/locations/burkina_faso/ Burkina Faso: Governmental Broadcasting Agencies]''</ref>

Attempts to develop an independent press and media in Burkina Faso have been intermittent. In 1998, investigative journalist [[Norbert Zongo]], his brother Ernest, his driver, and another man were assassinated by unknown assailants, and the bodies burned. The crime was never solved.<ref name=""autogenerated2"">Committee to Protect Journalists, [http://www.cpj.org/africa/burkina-faso/ ''Burkina Faso'']</ref> However, an independent Commission of Inquiry later concluded that Norbert Zongo was killed for political reasons because of his investigative work into the death of David Ouedraogo, a chauffeur who worked for François Compaoré, President Blaise Compaoré's brother.<ref name=""en.rsf.org"">Reporters Sans Frontieres, ''[http://en.rsf.org/predator-what-s-happening-about-the-inquiry-into-norbert-zongo-s-death,2485.html What's Happening About The Inquiry Into Norbert Zongo's Death?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421082231/http://en.rsf.org/predator-what-s-happening-about-the-inquiry-into-norbert-zongo-s-death%2C2485.html|date=21 April 2014 }}''</ref><ref name=""Outrageous Denial of Justice"">Reporters Sans Frontieres, ''[http://www.ifex.org/burkina_faso/2006/07/21/outrageous_denial_of_justice_in/ Outrageous Denial Of Justice]'' 21 July 2006</ref>

In January 1999, François Compaoré was charged with the murder of David Ouedraogo, who had died as a result of torture in January 1998. The charges were later dropped by a military tribunal after an appeal. In August 2000, five members of the President's personal security guard detail (''Régiment de la Sécurité Présidentielle'', or RSP) were charged with the murder of Ouedraogo. RSP members Marcel Kafando, Edmond Koama, and Ousseini Yaro, investigated as suspects in the Norbert Zongo assassination, were convicted in the Ouedraogo case and sentenced to lengthy prison terms.<ref name=""en.rsf.org""/><ref name=""Outrageous Denial of Justice""/>

Since the death of Norbert Zongo, several protests regarding the Zongo investigation and treatment of journalists have been prevented or dispersed by government police and security forces. In April 2007, popular radio reggae host [[Sams'K Le Jah|Karim Sama]], whose programs feature reggae songs interspersed with critical commentary on alleged government injustice and corruption, received several death threats.<ref>IFEX, ''[http://www.ifex.org/burkina_faso/2007/04/30/radio_station_temporarily_pulls/ Radio Station Temporarily Pulls Programme After Host Receives Death Threats]'', 26 April 2007</ref>

Sama's personal car was later burned outside the private radio station ''Ouaga FM'' by unknown vandals.<ref>FreeMuse.org, ''[http://freemuse.org/archives/928 Death threat against Reggae Radio Host] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426215002/http://freemuse.org/archives/928|date=26 April 2014 }}'', 3 May 2007</ref> In response, the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ) wrote to President Compaoré to request his government investigate the sending of e-mailed death threats to journalists and radio commentators in Burkina Faso who were critical of the government.<ref name=""autogenerated2""/> In December 2008, police in Ouagadougou questioned leaders of a protest march that called for a renewed investigation into the unsolved Zongo assassination. Among the marchers was Jean-Claude Meda, the president of the Association of Journalists of Burkina Faso.<ref>Keita, Mohamed, ''[http://cpj.org/blog/2008/12/burkina-faso-police-question-zongo-protesters.php#more Burkina Faso Police Question Zongo Protesters]'', Committee to Protect Journalists, 15 December 2008</ref>

===Cultural festivals and events===
Every two years, Ouagadougou hosts the [[Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou]] (FESPACO), the largest African cinema festival on the continent (February, odd years).

Held every two years since 1988, the [[International Art and Craft Fair, Ouagadougou]] (SIAO), is one of Africa's most important trade shows for art and handicrafts (late October-early November, even years).

Also every two years, the [[Symposium de sculpture sur granit de Laongo]] takes place on a site located about {{convert|35|km|abbr=off}} from [[Ouagadougou]], in the province of [[Oubritenga]].

The [[National Culture Week of Burkina Faso]], better known by its French name La Semaine Nationale de la culture (SNC), is one of the most important cultural activities of Burkina Faso. It is a biennial event which takes place every two years in Bobo Dioulasso, the second-largest city in the country.

The [[Festival International des Masques et des Arts]] (FESTIMA), celebrating [[Traditional African masks|traditional masks]], is held every two years in [[Dédougou]].

The [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] peoples have lived in Burundi for at least 500 years. For more than 200 of those years, Burundi was an independent [[Kingdom of Burundi|kingdom]] led by Tutsi kings imposing a caste system on the Hutu. In 1885, it became part of the German colony of [[German East Africa]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Helmut |last=Strizek |title=Geschenkte Kolonien: Ruanda und Burundi unter deutscher Herrschaft |trans-title=Donated colonies: Rwanda and Burundi under German rule |location=Berlin |publisher=Ch.

Burundi gained independence in 1962 and initially retained the [[Kingdom of Burundi|monarchy]], which was overthrown in a [[July 1966 Burundian coup d'état|1966 coup]], and replaced by a [[one-party state|one-party]] republic. Over the next 27 years, Burundi was ruled by a series of Tutsi dictators and notably experienced a [[Ikiza|genocide of Hutus in 1972]]. During the country's [[1993 Burundian presidential election|first multiparty elections in June 1993]], [[Melchior Ndadaye]] became the Burundi's first Hutu president. His assassination after only three months in power during an [[1993 Burundian coup attempt|October 1993 coup attempt]] provoked a [[Burundian Civil War|12-year civil war]].

==Etymology==
Modern Burundi is named after the [[Kingdom of Burundi|King of Urundi]], who ruled the region starting in the 16th century. It derives its name from a word ""Urundi"" in [[Rwanda-Rundi|Kirundi]] the local language, which means ""Another one"".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=translate+Urundi+in+English|title=How King Ntare Rushatsi of Urundi came up with the name of his founding Kingdom - Burundi's Name Origin|website=From Google}}</ref> Later the Belgian mandate to [[Ruanda-Urundi]] region came to rename it and their former capital [[Bujumbura|""Usumbura""]] of both kingdoms by adding the letter ""B"" in front of it.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Burundi|Ruanda-Urundi}}
Burundi is one of the few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, along with its neighbour Rwanda among others (such as [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], and [[Eswatini]]), to be a direct territorial continuation of a pre-colonial era African state. The early history of Burundi, and especially the role and nature of the country's three dominant ethnic groups, the Twa, Hutu and Tutsi, is highly debated amongst academics.<ref>Uvin, Peter. 1999. ""Ethnicity and Power in Burundi and Rwanda: Different Paths to Mass Violence"" in Comparative Politics, Vol. 31, No. 3 (Apr. 1999), pp. 253–272 Published by: Comparative Politics, Ph.D. Programs in Political Science, City University of New York. Page 254.</ref> 

===Kingdom of Burundi===
{{Main|Kingdom of Burundi}}
The first evidence of the Burundian state dates back to the late 16th century where it emerged on the eastern foothills. Over the following centuries it expanded, annexing smaller neighbours.
The Kingdom of Burundi, or Urundi, in the Great Lakes region was a polity ruled by a traditional monarch with several princes beneath him; succession struggles were common.<ref name=""auto"">""Kingdom of Burundi"". Encyclopædia Britannica (Online ed.). Retrieved 15 October 2016.</ref> The king, known as the ''mwami'' (translated as ruler) headed a princely aristocracy (''ganwa'') which owned most of the land and required a tribute, or tax, from local farmers (mainly Hutu) and herders (mainly Tutsi). The Kingdom of Burundi was characterised by a hierarchical political authority and tributary economic exchange.<ref>VANDEGINSTE, S., Stones left unturned: law and transitional justice in Burundi, Antwerp-Oxford-Portland, Intersentia, 2010, p 17.</ref>

In the mid-18th century, the Tutsi royalty consolidated authority over land, production, and distribution with the development of the ubugabire—a patron-client relationship in which the populace received royal protection in exchange for tribute and land tenure. By this time, the royal court was made up of the Tutsi-Banyaruguru. They had higher social status than other pastoralists such as the Tutsi-Hima. In the lower levels of this society were generally Hutu people, and at the very bottom of the pyramid were the Twa. The system had some fluidity, however. Some Hutu people belonged to the nobility and in this way also had a say in the functioning of the state.<ref>R. O. Collins & J. M. Burns. 2007. A History of Sub-Saharan Africa, Cambridge University Press. Page 125.</ref>

The classification of Hutu or Tutsi was not merely based on ethnic criteria alone. Hutu farmers that managed to acquire wealth and livestock were regularly granted the higher social status of Tutsi, some even made it to become close advisors of the ''Ganwa''. On the other hand, there are also reports of Tutsi that lost all their cattle and subsequently lost their higher status and were called Hutu. Thus, the distinction between Hutu and Tutsi was also a socio-cultural concept, instead of a purely ethnic one.<ref>Chrétien, Jean-Pierre (2003).

===Rule by Germany and Belgium===
{{Main|German East Africa|Ruanda-Urundi}}
From 1884, the [[German East Africa Company]] was active in the African Great Lakes region. As a result of heightened tensions and border disputes between the German East Africa Company, the [[British Empire]] and the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]], the [[German Empire]] was called upon to put down the [[Abushiri revolt]]s and protect the empire's interests in the region. The German East Africa Company transferred its rights to the German Empire in 1891, in this way establishing the German colony of [[German East Africa]], which included Burundi (Urundi), Rwanda (Ruanda), and the mainland part of [[Tanzania]] (formerly known as [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]]).<ref name=EBArchived>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/German-East-Africa|title=German East Africa {{!}} former German dependency, Africa |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=16 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902012730/https://www.britannica.com/place/German-East-Africa|archive-date=2 September 2017|url-status=live |quote=In archived text: German East Africa, German Deutsch-Ostafrika, former dependency of imperial Germany, corresponding to present-day Rwanda and Burundi, the continental portion of Tanzania, and a small section of Mozambique. Penetration of the area was begun in 1884 by German commercial agents, and German claims were recognized by the other European powers in the period 1885–94. In 1891 the German imperial government took over administration of the area from the German East Africa Company. Although its subjugation was not completed until 1907, the colony experienced considerable economic development before World War I. During the war it was occupied by the British, who received a mandate to administer the greater part of it (Tanganyika Territory) by the Treaty of Versailles (signed June 1919; enacted January 1920). A smaller portion (Ruanda-Urundi) was entrusted to Belgium.}}</ref> The German Empire stationed armed forces in Rwanda and Burundi during the late 1880s. The location of the present-day city of [[Gitega]] served as an administrative centre for the Ruanda-Urundi region.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Gitega|title=Gitega {{!}} Burundi|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=16 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902015516/https://www.britannica.com/place/Gitega|archive-date=2 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the [[World War I|First World War]], the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]] greatly affected the African Great Lakes region. The [[Belgian Congo|Belgian]] and [[British Empire|British]] colonial forces of the [[Allies of World War I|allied powers]] launched a [[Tabora offensive|coordinated attack]] on the German colony. The German army stationed in Burundi was forced to retreat by the numerical superiority of the Belgian army and by 17 June 1916, Burundi and Rwanda were occupied. The [[Force Publique]] and the British [[Lake Force]] then started a thrust to capture [[Tabora]], an administrative centre of central German East Africa. After the war, as outlined in the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Germany was forced to cede ""control"" of the Western section of the former German East Africa to Belgium.<ref name=""state""/><ref>Strachan, H.

On 20 October 1924, [[Ruanda-Urundi]], which consisted of modern-day Rwanda and Burundi, became a Belgian [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandate territory]], with [[Bujumbura|Usumbura]] as its capital. In practical terms it was considered part of the [[Belgian colonial empire]].

The Belgians, however, preserved many of the kingdom's institutions; the Burundian monarchy succeeded in surviving into the post-colonial period.<ref name=""auto""/> Following the [[Second World War]], Ruanda-Urundi was classified as a [[United Nations Trust Territory]] under Belgian administrative authority.<ref name=""cia""/> During the 1940s, a series of policies caused divisions throughout the country. On 4 October 1943, powers were split in the legislative division of Burundi's government between chiefdoms and lower chiefdoms. Chiefdoms were in charge of land, and lower sub-chiefdoms were established. Native authorities also had powers.<ref name=""wein5""/> In 1948, Belgium allowed the region to form [[political parties]].<ref name=""state""/> These factions contributed to Burundi gaining its independence from Belgium, on 1 July 1962.

King Mwambutsa, who had fled the country during the October coup of 1965, was deposed by a [[July 1966 Burundian coup d'état|coup in July 1966]] and his teenage son, [[Ntare V of Burundi|Prince Ntare V]], claimed the throne. In November that same year, the Tutsi Prime Minister, then-Captain Michel Micombero, carried out another [[November 1966 Burundian coup d'état|coup]], this time deposing Ntare, abolishing the monarchy and declaring the nation a [[republic]], though his one-party government was effectively a [[military dictatorship]].<ref name=""state""/> As president, Micombero became an advocate of [[African socialism]] and received support from the People's Republic of China.

Following the civil war and genocide, Micombero became mentally distraught and withdrawn. In 1976, Colonel [[Jean-Baptiste Bagaza]], a Tutsi, led a [[1976 Burundian coup d'état|bloodless coup]] to topple Micombero and set about promoting reform. His administration drafted a new constitution in 1981, which maintained Burundi's status as a [[one-party state]].<ref name=""news.bbc.co.uk""/> In August 1984, Bagaza was elected head of state. During his tenure, Bagaza suppressed political opponents and religious freedoms.

Major [[Pierre Buyoya]], a Tutsi, [[1987 Burundian coup d'état|overthrew Bagaza in 1987]], suspended the constitution and dissolved political parties. He reinstated military rule by a Military Committee for National Salvation (CSMN).<ref name=""news.bbc.co.uk""/> Anti-Tutsi ethnic propaganda disseminated by the remnants of the 1972 UBU, which had re-organized as PALIPEHUTU in 1981, led to killings of Tutsi peasants in the northern communes of [[Ntega]] and [[Marangara]] in August 1988. The government put the death toll at 5,000{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}; some international NGOs believed this understated the deaths.

The new regime did not unleash the harsh reprisals of 1972. Its effort to gain public trust was eroded when it decreed an [[amnesty]] for those who had called for, carried out, and taken credit for the killings. Analysts have called this period the beginning of the ""culture of impunity."" Other analysts put the origins of the ""culture of impunity"" earlier, in 1965 and 1972, when a small number of identifiable Hutus unleashed massive killings of Tutsis.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In the aftermath of the killings, a group of Hutu intellectuals wrote an open letter to [[Pierre Buyoya]], asking for more representation of the Hutu in the administration. They were arrested and jailed. A few weeks later, Buyoya appointed a new government, with an equal number of Hutu and Tutsi ministers. He appointed [[Adrien Sibomana]] (Hutu) as Prime Minister. Buyoya also created a commission to address issues of national unity.<ref name=""news.bbc.co.uk""/> In 1992, the government created a new constitution that provided for a multi-party system,<ref name=""news.bbc.co.uk""/> but a [[civil war]] broke out.

===First attempt at democracy and war between Tutsi National Army and Hutu population===
In June 1993, [[Melchior Ndadaye]], leader of the Hutu-dominated [[Front for Democracy in Burundi]] (FRODEBU), won the first democratic election. He became the first Hutu head of state, leading a pro-Hutu government. Though he attempted to smooth the country's bitter ethnic divide, his reforms antagonised soldiers in the Tutsi-dominated army, and he was assassinated amidst a failed military coup in October 1993, after only three months in office. The ensuing [[Burundian Civil War]] (1993–2005) saw persistent violence between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi majority army. It is estimated that some 300,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the years following the assassination.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1068873.stm Country profile Burundi] BBC. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007175839/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1068873.stm |date=7 October 2011 }}.

In early 1994, the parliament elected [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]] (Hutu) to the office of president. He and [[Juvénal Habyarimana]], the president of Rwanda, both Hutus, died together [[Assassination of Habyarimana and Ntaryamira|when their airplane was shot down]] in April 1994. More refugees started fleeing to Rwanda. Speaker of Parliament, [[Sylvestre Ntibantunganya]] (Hutu), was appointed as president in October 1994. A coalition government involving 12 of the 13 parties was formed. A feared general massacre was averted, but violence broke out. A number of Hutu refugees in Bujumbura,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} the then-capital, were killed. The mainly Tutsi Union for National Progress withdrew from the government and parliament.

In 1996, [[Pierre Buyoya]] (Tutsi) again took power through a [[1996 Burundian coup d'état|coup d'état]]. He suspended the constitution and was sworn in as president in 1998. This was the start of his second term as president, after his first term from 1987 to 1993. In response to rebel attacks, the government forced much of the population to move to [[refugee camp]]s.{{cn|date=February 2023}} Under Buyoya's rule, long peace talks started, mediated by [[South Africa]]. Both parties signed agreements in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Pretoria]], South Africa, to share power in Burundi. The agreements took four years to plan.

On 28 August 2000, a transitional government for Burundi was planned as a part of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement. The transitional government was placed on a trial basis for five years. After several aborted cease-fires, a 2001 peace plan and power-sharing agreement has been relatively successful. A cease-fire was signed in 2003 between the Tutsi-controlled Burundian government and the largest Hutu rebel group, CNDD-FDD (National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy).<ref>[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/OCHA-64D9N7?OpenDocument Global Ceasefire Agreement between Burundi and the CNDD-FDD]. 20 November 2003.

===Peace agreements===
African leaders began a series of peace talks between the warring factions following a request by the United Nations Secretary General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] for them to intervene in the humanitarian crisis. Talks were initiated under the aegis of former Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] in 1995; following his death, South African President [[Nelson Mandela]] took the helm. As the talks progressed, South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]] and United States President [[Bill Clinton]] also lent their respective weight.

The peace talks took the form of [[Track I mediation]]s. This method of negotiation can be defined as a form of diplomacy involving governmental or intergovernmental representatives, who may use their positive reputations, mediation, or the ""carrot and stick"" method as a means of obtaining or forcing an outcome, frequently along the lines of ""bargaining"" or ""win-lose"".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ramsbotham, Oliver |author2=Woodhouse, Tom |author3=Miall, Hugh |title=Contemporary Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IbuQE02-KkC&pg=PA24|year=2011|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-4974-0|pages=24–}}</ref>

The main objective was to transform the Burundian government and military structurally in order to bridge the ethnic gap between the Tutsi and Hutu. It was to take place in two major steps. First, a transitional power-sharing government would be established, with the presidents holding office for three-year terms. The second objective involved a restructuring of the armed forces, where the two groups would be represented equally.

As the protracted nature of the peace talks demonstrated, the mediators and negotiating parties confronted several obstacles. First, the Burundian officials perceived the goals as ""unrealistic"" and viewed the treaty as ambiguous, contradictory and confusing. Second, and perhaps most importantly, the Burundians believed the treaty would be irrelevant without an accompanying cease fire. This would require separate and direct talks with the rebel groups. The main Hutu party was skeptical of the offer of a power-sharing government; they alleged that they had been deceived by the Tutsi in past agreements.

In 2000,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/jan-van-eck-peace-mediator-in-burundi/|title=Jan van Eck – peace mediator in Burundi|date=7 August 2000|website=Radio Netherlands Archives|language=en-GB|access-date=4 July 2019}}</ref> the Burundian President signed the treaty, as well as 13 of the 19 warring Hutu and Tutsi factions. Disagreements persisted over which group would preside over the nascent government, and when the ceasefire would begin. The spoilers of the peace talks were the hardliner Tutsi and Hutu groups who refused to sign the accord; as a result, violence intensified. Three years later at a summit of African leaders in Tanzania, the Burundian president and the main opposition Hutu group signed an accord to end the conflict; the signatory members were granted ministerial posts within the government. However, smaller militant Hutu groups – such as the Forces for National Liberation – remained active.

Between 1993 and 2003, many rounds of peace talks, overseen by regional leaders in Tanzania, South Africa and [[Uganda]], gradually established power-sharing agreements to satisfy the majority of the contending groups. Initially the South African Protection Support Detachment was deployed to protect Burundian leaders returning from exile. These forces became part of the [[African Union Mission in Burundi|African Union Mission to Burundi]], deployed to help oversee the installation of a transitional government. In June 2004, the UN stepped in and took over peacekeeping responsibilities as a signal of growing international support for the already markedly advanced peace process in Burundi.<ref name=""Howard, Lise Morje 2008"">Howard, Lise Morje (2008). UN Peacekeeping in Civil Wars. New York: Cambridge University Press.</ref>

The mission's mandate, under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]], has been to monitor cease-fire, carry out disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former military personnel, support humanitarian assistance and refugee and IDP return, assist with elections, protect international staff and Burundian civilians, monitor Burundi's troublesome borders, including halting illicit arms flows, and assist in carrying out institutional reforms including those of the Constitution, judiciary, armed forces and police. The mission has been allotted 5,650 military personnel, 120 civilian police and about 1,000 international and local civilian personnel. The mission has been functioning well. It has greatly benefited from the transitional government, which has functioned and is in the process of transitioning to one that will be popularly elected.<ref name=""Howard, Lise Morje 2008""/>

The main difficulty in the early stages was continued resistance to the peace process by the last Hutu nationalist rebel group. This organisation continued its violent conflict on the outskirts of the capital despite the UN's presence. By June 2005, the group had stopped fighting and its representatives were brought back into the political process. All political parties have accepted a formula for inter-ethnic power-sharing: no political party can gain access to government offices unless it is ethnically integrated.<ref name=""Howard, Lise Morje 2008""/>

The focus of the UN's mission had been to enshrine the power-sharing arrangements in a popularly voted constitution, so that elections may be held and a new government installed. Disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration were done in tandem with elections preparations. In February 2005, the [[Constitution of Burundi|constitution]] was approved with over 90% of the popular vote. In May, June and August 2005, three separate elections were also held at the local level for the Parliament and the presidency.

While there are still some difficulties with refugee returns and securing adequate food supplies for the war-weary population, the mission managed to win the trust and confidence of a majority of the formerly warring leaders, as well as the population at large.<ref name=""Howard, Lise Morje 2008""/> It was involved with several ""quick effect"" projects, including rehabilitating and building schools, orphanages, health clinics and rebuilding infrastructure such as water lines.

There is an urgent need for reform of the judicial system. [[Genocide]], [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] continued to go unpunished.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

In late March 2008, the FLN sought for the parliament to adopt a law guaranteeing them 'provisional immunity' from arrest. This would cover ordinary crimes, but not grave violations of international humanitarian law like war crimes or crimes against humanity .<ref name=""hrw.org""/> Even though the government has granted this in the past to people, the FLN has been unable to obtain the provisional immunity.

On 17 April 2008, the FLN bombarded Bujumbura. The Burundian army fought back and the FLN suffered heavy losses. A new ceasefire was signed on 26 May 2008. In August 2008, President Nkurunziza met with the FLN leader [[Agathon Rwasa]], with the mediation of [[Charles Nqakula]], South Africa's Minister for Safety and Security. This was the first direct meeting since June 2007. Both agreed to meet twice a week to establish a commission to resolve any disputes that might arise during the peace negotiations.<ref>[http://www.pbcupdate.org/?p=114#more-114 Peace Building Commission Update, A project of the Institute for Global Policy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819200320/http://www.pbcupdate.org/?p=114#more-114 |date=19 August 2017 }}, 2008</ref>

The UN has attempted to evaluate the impact of its peace-building initiatives. In the early 2010s, the UN peacekeeping mission in Burundi sought to assess the success of its Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration program by counting the number of arms that had been collected, given the prevalence of arms in the country. However, these evaluations failed to include date from local populations, which are significant in impact evaluations of peacebuilding initiatives.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Autesserre|first1=Séverine|url=https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780197530351.001.0001/oso-9780197530351|title=The Frontlines of Peace: An Insider's Guide to Changing the World|last2=Gbowee|first2=Leymah|date=2021-05-03|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-753035-1|edition=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/oso/9780197530351.001.0001}}</ref>

Other agricultural products include cotton, tea, maize, [[sorghum]], sweet potatoes, bananas, [[manioc]] (tapioca); beef, milk and hides. Even though [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]] is highly relied upon, many people do not have the resources to sustain themselves. This is due to large population growth and no coherent policies governing land ownership. In 2014, the average farm size was about one acre.

The purchasing power of most Burundians has decreased as wage increases have not kept up with inflation. As a result of deepening poverty, Burundi will remain heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and multilateral donors. Foreign aid represents 42% of Burundi's national income, the second highest rate in Sub-Saharan Africa. Burundi joined the East African Community in 2009, which should boost its regional trade ties, and also in 2009 received $700 million in debt relief.

Lack of access to financial services is a serious problem for the majority of the population, particularly in the densely populated rural areas: only 2% of the total population holds bank accounts, and fewer than 0.5% use bank lending services. [[Microfinance]], however, plays a larger role, with 4% of Burundians being members of microfinance institutions – a larger share of the population than that reached by banking and postal services combined. 26 licensed microfinance institutions (MFIs) offer savings, deposits and short- to medium-term credit.

{{Main|Culture of Burundi|Tourism in Burundi|Music of Burundi}}

Burundi's culture is based on local tradition and the influence of neighbouring countries, though cultural prominence has been hindered by [[civil unrest]]. Since farming is the main industry, a typical Burundian meal consists of [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize|corn]], [[rice]] and [[pea]]s. Due to the expense, meat is eaten only a few times per month.

When several Burundians of close acquaintance meet for a gathering they drink ''impeke'', a beer, together from a large container to symbolise unity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/burundi/eating.html |title=Eating the Burundian Way |access-date=21 July 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616201411/http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/burundi/eating.html |archive-date=16 June 2006}} Cultural Profiles Project.

Notable Burundians include the footballer [[Mohammed Tchité]] and singer [[Jean-Pierre Nimbona]], popularly known as Kidumu (who is based in [[Nairobi]], Kenya).

Crafts are an important art form in Burundi and are attractive gifts to many tourists. Basket weaving is a popular craft for local artisans,<ref>Levin, Adam (2005). ''The Art of African Shopping''.

===Science and technology===

Burundi's ''Strategic Plan for Science, Technology, Research and Innovation'' (2013) covers the following areas: food technology; medical sciences; energy, mining and transportation; water; desertification; environmental biotechnology and indigenous knowledge; materials science; engineering and industry; ICTs; space sciences; mathematical sciences; and social and human sciences.

With regard to material sciences, Burundi's publication intensity doubled from 0.6 to 1.2 articles per million inhabitants between 2012 and 2019, placing it in the top 15 for sub-Saharan Africa for this strategic technology.<ref name=""Kingiri & Onana 2021"">{{cite book |author1=Njoki Kingiri |url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000377433 |title=Central and East Africa. In UNESCO Science Report: the Race Against Time for Smarter Development. |author2=Awono Onana |date=11 June 2021 |publisher=UNESCO |isbn=978-92-3-100450-6 |editor1-last=Schneegans |editor1-first=S. |location=Paris |pages=496–533 |editor2-last=Straza |editor2-first=T. |editor3-last=Lewis |editor3-first=J.}}</ref>

Medical sciences remain the main focus of research: medical researchers accounted for 4% of the country's scientists in 2018 but 41% of scientific publications between 2011 and 2019.<ref name=""Kingiri & Onana 2021""/>

The focus of the ''Strategic Plan for Science, Technology, Research and Innovation'' (2013) has been on developing an institutional framework and infrastructure, fostering greater regional and international co-operation and placing science in society. In October 2014, the EAC Secretariat designated the National Institute of Public Health a centre of excellence. Data are unavailable on output on nutritional sciences, the institute's area of specialization, but between 2011 and 2019, Burundi scientists produced seven articles on each of HIV and tropical communicable diseases and a further five on tuberculosis, all focus areas for the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].<ref name=""Kingiri & Onana 2021""/>

The ''Strategic Plan'' has also focused on training researchers. Researcher density (in head counts) grew from 40 to 55 researchers per million inhabitants between 2011 and 2018. The amount of funding available to each researcher more than doubled from PPP$14,310 (constant 2005 values) to PPP$22,480, since the domestic research effort has also risen since 2012, from 0.11% to 0.21% of GDP.<ref name=""Kingiri & Onana 2021""/>

Burundi has almost tripled its scientific output since 2011 but the pace has not picked up since the adoption of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] in 2015. With six scientific publications per million inhabitants, Burundi still has one of the lowest publication rate in Central and East Africa.<ref name=""Kingiri & Onana 2021""/> Some 97.5% of publications involved foreign co-authorship between 2017 and 2019, with Ugandans figuring among the top five partners.<ref name=""Kingiri & Onana 2021""/>

'''Cameroon''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-Cameroon-pronunciation.ogg|ˌ|k|æ|m|ə|ˈ|r|uː|n}} {{respell|CAM|ə|ROON}}; {{lang-fr|Cameroun}}), officially the '''Republic of Cameroon''' ({{lang-fr|République du Cameroun|links=no}}), is a country in [[Central Africa]]. It shares boundaries with [[Nigeria]] to the west and north, [[Chad]] to the northeast, the [[Central African Republic]] to the east, and [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the south. Its coastline lies on the [[Bight of Biafra]], part of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Due to its strategic position at the crossroads between [[West Africa]] and [[Central Africa]], it has been categorized as being in both camps. Its nearly 27 million people speak 250 native languages, in addition to the national tongues of English and French, or both.<ref name="":5"" /><ref name="":4"" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/CM|title=Cameroon|website=Ethnologue|access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref>

Early inhabitants of the territory included the [[Sao civilisation]] around [[Lake Chad]], and the [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest. [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorers]] reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area ''Rio dos Camarões'' (''Shrimp River''), which became ''Cameroon'' in English. [[Fula people|Fulani]] soldiers founded the [[Adamawa Emirate]] in the north in the 19th century, and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and [[Fon (title)|fondoms]].

Cameroon became a [[German Empire|German colony]] in 1884 known as [[Kamerun]]. After [[World War I]], it was divided between [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as [[League of Nations mandate]]s. The [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon|Union des Populations du Cameroun]] (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed by France in the 1950s, leading to the [[Bamileke War|national liberation insurgency]] fought between French and UPC militant forces until early 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroun, under President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]]. The [[Southern Cameroons|southern part]] of the [[British Cameroon]]s federated with it in 1961 to form the [[Federal republic|Federal Republic]] of Cameroon. The federation was abandoned in favour of the unitary United Republic of Cameroon in 1972, and then reverted to the Republic of Cameroon name in 1984 by decree of President [[Paul Biya]]. Biya, the incumbent president, has led the country since 1982 following Ahidjo's resignation; he previously held office as prime minister from 1975 onward. Cameroon is governed as a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Presidential system|presidential republic]].

The [[official language]]s of Cameroon are French and English, the official languages of the former [[French Cameroon]]s and [[British Cameroon]]s. [[Christianity]] is the majority [[religion in Cameroon]], with significant minorities practising [[Islam in Cameroon|Islam]] and [[Traditional African religions|traditional faiths]]. It has experienced [[Anglophone problem|tensions]] from the English-speaking territories, where politicians have advocated for greater decentralisation and even complete separation or independence (as in the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]]). In 2017, tensions over the creation of an [[Ambazonia]]n state in the English-speaking territories escalated into [[Anglophone Crisis|open warfare]].

Large numbers of Cameroonians live as [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]]. The country is often referred to as ""Africa in miniature"" for its geological, linguistic and cultural diversity.<ref name="":5"" /><ref>[https://archive.today/20120525195312/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html Highest Average Annual Precipitation Extremes].

Its most populous cities are [[Douala]] on the [[Wouri River]], its economic capital and main seaport; [[Yaoundé]], its political capital; and [[Garoua]].

==Etymology==
Originally, Cameroon was the [[exonym]] given by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] to the [[Wouri River]], which they called ''Rio dos Camarões'' meaning ""river of [[shrimps]]"" or ""shrimp river"", referring to the then abundant [[Cameroon ghost shrimp]].<ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/word/cameroon Cameroon (adj.)] nation in West Africa, its name is taken from the Anglicized form of the former name of the River Wouri, which was called by the Portuguese Rio dos Camarões ""river of prawns"" (16th century) for the abundance of these they found in its broad estuary. ''Camarões'' is from Latin ''cammarus'' ""crawfish, prawn"".</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Camarões: o que os crustáceos têm a ver com o país?

==History==
{{Main|History of Cameroon}}

===Early history===
[[File:Shumom-text.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bamum script]] is a writing system developed by King Njoya in the late 19th century.]]
Present-day Cameroon was first settled in the [[Neolithic]] Era. The longest continuous inhabitants are groups such as the [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] ([[Pygmy peoples|Pygmies]]).<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 2.</ref> From there, [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]] into eastern, southern and central Africa are believed to have occurred about 2,000 years ago.<ref name=""history""/> The [[Sao civilisation|Sao]] culture arose around [[Lake Chad]], {{circa|500 CE}}, and gave way to the Kanem and its successor state, the [[Kanem–Bornu Empire|Bornu Empire]]. Kingdoms, [[Fon (title)|fondoms]], and [[chiefdom]]s arose in the west.<ref name=Njung/>

[[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese sailors]] reached the coast in 1472. They noted an abundance of the ghost shrimp ''[[Lepidophthalmus turneranus]]'' in the [[Wouri River]] and named it {{lang|pt|Rio dos Camarões}} (''Shrimp River''), which became ''Cameroon'' in English.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pondi |first=J.E. |title=Cameroon and the Commonwealth of nations |journal=The Round Table |volume=86 |issue=344 |pages=563–570 |year=1997 |doi=10.1080/00358539708454389}}</ref> Over the following few centuries, European interests regularised trade with the coastal peoples, and Christian [[missionaries]] pushed inland.<ref name=Fanso/>

In 1896, Sultan [[Ibrahim Njoya]] created the [[Bamum script]], or Shu Mom, for the [[Bamum language]].<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 59</ref><ref name=""NMAA"">{{cite web|url=http://africa.si.edu/exhibits/inscribing/bamum.html|title=Bamum|publisher=National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution|access-date=29 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101155844/http://africa.si.edu/exhibits/inscribing/bamum.html|archive-date=1 January 2012}}</ref> It is taught in Cameroon today by the [[Bamum Scripts and Archives Project]].<ref name=""NMAA""/>

===German rule===
{{main|Kamerun}}
Germany began to establish roots in Cameroon in 1868 when the Woermann Company of Hamburg built a warehouse. It was built on the estuary of the Wouri River. Later Gustav Nachtigal made a treaty with one of the local kings to annex the region for the German emperor.<ref name=historyworld>{{cite web|url=http://historyworld.net|title=historyworld|access-date=17 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407073336/http://historyworld.net/|archive-date=7 April 2019}}</ref> The [[German Empire]] claimed the territory as the colony of [[Kamerun]] in 1884 and began a steady push inland; the natives resisted. Under the aegis of Germany, commercial companies were local administrations. These [[Concession (contract)|concession]]s used [[Unfree labour|forced labour]] to run profitable banana, rubber, palm oil, and cocoa plantations.<ref name=historyworld/> Even infrastructure projects relied on a regimen of forced labour. This economic policy was much criticised by the other colonial powers.<ref name=""DeLancey 125"">[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 125.</ref>

===French and British rule===
{{main|French Cameroon|British Cameroon}}
[[File:UPC-LEADERS.jpg|thumb|right|Leaders of the pro-independence [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon|UPC]]]]
With the defeat of Germany in [[World War I]], Kamerun became a [[League of Nations mandate]] territory and was split into [[French Cameroon]] ({{lang-fr|Cameroun}}) and [[British Cameroon]] in 1919. France integrated the economy of Cameroon with that of France<ref name=""DeLancey 5"">[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 5.</ref> and improved the infrastructure with capital investments and skilled workers, modifying the colonial system of forced labour.<ref name=""DeLancey 125""/>

The British administered their territory from neighbouring [[Nigeria]]. Natives complained that this made them a neglected ""colony of a colony"". Nigerian migrant workers flocked to Southern Cameroons, ending forced labour altogether but angering the local natives, who felt swamped.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 4.</ref> The League of Nations mandates were converted into [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|United Nations Trusteeships]] in 1946, and the question of independence became a pressing issue in French Cameroon.<ref name=""DeLancey 5""/>

France outlawed the pro-independence political party, the [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon]] (''Union des Populations du Cameroun''; UPC), on 13 July 1955.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Terretta | first1 = M. | title = Cameroonian Nationalists Go Global: From Forest Maquis to a Pan-African Accra | doi = 10.1017/S0021853710000253 | journal = The Journal of African History | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 189–212 | year = 2010 | s2cid = 154604590 }}</ref> This prompted a [[Bamileke War|long guerrilla war]] waged by the UPC and the assassination of several of the party's leaders, including [[Ruben Um Nyobè]], [[Félix-Roland Moumié]] and [[Ernest Ouandie]].

===Independence===
[[File:Ahmadou Ahidjo.jpg|thumb|Former president [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]] ruled from 1960 until 1982.]]

On 1 January 1960, French Cameroun gained independence from France under President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]]. On 1 October 1961, the formerly British [[Southern Cameroons]] gained independence from the United Kingdom by vote of the UN General Assembly and joined with French Cameroun to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon, a date which is now observed as [[Unification Day (Cameroon)|Unification Day]], a [[Public holidays in Cameroon|public holiday]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Diane Cook|title=Cameroon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jn7TBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT95|date=2 September 2014|publisher=Mason Crest|isbn=978-1-4222-9434-5|page=95}}</ref> Ahidjo used the ongoing war with the UPC to concentrate power in the presidency, continuing with this even after the suppression of the UPC in 1971.<ref name=""DeLancey 6"">[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 6.</ref>

His political party, the [[Cameroonian National Union|Cameroon National Union]] (CNU), became the sole legal political party on 1 September 1966 and on 20 May 1972, a referendum was passed to abolish the [[Federation|federal system of government]] in favour of a United Republic of Cameroon, headed from [[Yaoundé]].<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 19.</ref> This day is now the country's [[National Day (Cameroon)|National Day]], a public holiday.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.prc.cm/en/multimedia/photo-albums/37-20-may-national-day |title=20 May National Day |website=Presidency of the Republic of Cameroon |access-date=3 May 2019 }}</ref> Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of [[planned liberalism]], prioritising [[cash crops]] and petroleum development. The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 7.</ref>

The [[Flag of Cameroon|national flag]] was changed on 20 May 1975. Two stars were removed, replaced with a large central star as a symbol of national unity.

Ahidjo stepped down on 4 November 1982 and left power to his constitutional successor, [[Paul Biya]]. However, Ahidjo remained in control of the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya began his administration by moving toward a more democratic government, but a failed [[Cameroonian Palace Guard Revolt|coup d'état]] nudged him toward the leadership style of his predecessor.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 8.</ref>

An [[Economic crisis of Cameroon|economic crisis]] took effect in the mid-1980s to late 1990s as a result of international economic conditions, drought, falling [[petroleum]] prices, and years of corruption, mismanagement, and [[cronyism]]. Cameroon turned to foreign aid, cut government spending, and [[Privatization|privatised]] industries. With the reintroduction of multi-party politics in December 1990, the former British Southern Cameroons pressure groups called for greater autonomy, and the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]] advocated complete secession as the Republic of [[Ambazonia]].<ref name=""DeLancey 9"">[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 9.</ref> The 1992 Labour Code of Cameroon gives workers the freedom to belong to a trade union or not to belong to any trade union at all.

In June 2006, talks concerning a territorial dispute over the [[Bakassi]] peninsula were resolved. The talks involved President Paul Biya of Cameroon, then President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] of Nigeria and then UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]], and resulted in Cameroonian control of the oil-rich peninsula. The northern portion of the territory was formally handed over to the Cameroonian government in August 2006, and the remainder of the peninsula was left to Cameroon two years later, in 2008.<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/200606130612.html Cameroon: Presidents Obasanjo And Biya Shake Hands on Disputed Bakassi Peninsula] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217063651/http://allafrica.com/stories/200606130612.html |date=17 February 2017 }}, ''Allafrica'', 13 June 2006</ref> The boundary change triggered a [[Bakassi conflict|local separatist insurgency]], as many Bakassians refused to accept Cameroonian rule.

Cameroon is a member of both the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and [[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie|La Francophonie]].

Its [[Foreign relations of Cameroon|foreign policy]] closely follows that of its main ally, France (one of its former colonial rulers).<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 126</ref><ref>Ngoh 328.</ref> Cameroon relies heavily on France for its defence,<ref name=""State Dept""/> although military spending is high in comparison to other sectors of government.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 30.</ref>

President Biya has engaged in a decades-long clash with the government of Nigeria over possession of the oil-rich [[Bakassi]] peninsula.<ref name=""lergai"" /> Cameroon and Nigeria share a 1,000-mile (1,600&nbsp;km) border and have disputed the sovereignty of the Bakassi peninsula. In 1994 Cameroon petitioned the [[International Court of Justice]] to resolve the dispute. The two countries attempted to establish a cease-fire in 1996; however, fighting continued for years. In 2002, the ICJ ruled that the [[Anglo-German Agreement of 1913]] gave sovereignty to Cameroon. The ruling called for a withdrawal by both countries and denied the request by Cameroon for compensation due to Nigeria's long-term occupation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/11/world/court-rules-for-cameroon-in-oil-dispute-with-nigeria.html|title=Court Rules for Cameroon In Oil Dispute With Nigeria|last=Banerjee|first=Marc Lacey With Neela|date=11 October 2002|work=The New York Times|access-date=4 February 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205130042/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/11/world/court-rules-for-cameroon-in-oil-dispute-with-nigeria.html|archive-date=5 February 2018}}</ref> By 2004, Nigeria had failed to meet the deadline to hand over the peninsula.

The [[Constitution of Cameroon|constitution]] divides Cameroon into 10 semi-autonomous regions, each under the administration of an elected [[Regional Council (Cameroon)|Regional Council]]. Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor.<ref name=""Neba 250""/>

These leaders are charged with implementing the will of the president, reporting on the general mood and conditions of the regions, administering the civil service, keeping the peace, and overseeing the heads of the smaller administrative units. Governors have broad powers: they may order propaganda in their area and call in the army, [[Gendarmerie|gendarmes]], and police.<ref name=""Neba 250""/> All local government officials are employees of the central government's Ministry of Territorial Administration, from which local governments also get most of their budgets.<ref name=""history"">{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26431.htm|title=Cameroon|publisher=US Department of State|date=25 August 2011|access-date=24 September 2011}}</ref>

The regions are subdivided into 58 divisions (French {{lang|fr|départements}}). These are headed by presidentially appointed divisional officers ({{lang|fr|[[Prefect|préfets]]}}). The divisions are further split into sub-divisions ({{lang|fr|arrondissements}}), headed by assistant divisional officers ({{lang|fr|sous-prefets}}).

Directly south of them are the [[Centre Region (Cameroon)|Centre]] ({{lang|fr|Centre}}) and [[East Region (Cameroon)|East]] ({{lang|fr|Est}}). The [[South Region (Cameroon)|South Province]] ({{lang|fr|Sud}}) lies on the Gulf of Guinea and the southern border. Cameroon's western region is split into four smaller regions: the [[Littoral Region (Cameroon)|Littoral]] ({{lang|fr|Littoral}}) and [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|South-West]] ({{lang|fr|Sud-Ouest}}) regions are on the coast, and the [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|North-West]] ({{lang|fr|Nord-Ouest}}) and [[West Region (Cameroon)|West]] ({{lang|fr|Ouest}}) regions are in the western grassfields.<ref name=unhchr/>

In northern Cameroon, the [[Benue River|Bénoué River]] runs north and west and empties into the [[Niger River|Niger]]. The [[Logon River|Logone]] flows northward into Lake Chad, which Cameroon shares with three neighbouring countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Country Files: Cameroon|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/T0360E/T0360E04.htm|publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization|access-date=3 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611075925/http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/t0360e/T0360E04.htm|archive-date=11 June 2013}}</ref>

An estimated 70% of the population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 16.7% of GDP in 2017.<ref name=""CIA""/> Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice.

Cameroon has slightly more women (50.5%) than men (49.5%). Over 60% of the population is under age 25. People over 65 years of age account for only 3.11% of the total population.<ref name=""CIA"" />

Cameroon's population is almost evenly divided between urban and rural dwellers.<ref name=""West 3"">[[#West|West]] 3.</ref> Population density is highest in the large urban centres, the western highlands, and the northeastern plain.<ref>[[#Neba|Neba]] 109–11.</ref> Douala, Yaoundé, and [[Garoua]] are the largest cities. In contrast, the Adamawa Plateau, southeastern Bénoué depression, and most of the South Cameroon Plateau are sparsely populated.<ref>[[#Neba|Neba]] 111.</ref>

According to the [[World Health Organization]], the [[fertility rate]] was 4.8 in 2013 with a population growth rate of 2.56%.<ref name="":1"" />

People from the overpopulated western highlands and the underdeveloped north are moving to the coastal plantation zone and urban centres for employment.<ref>[[#Neba|Neba]] 105–6.</ref> Smaller movements are occurring as workers seek employment in lumber mills and plantations in the south and east.<ref>[[#Neba|Neba]] 106.</ref> Although the national sex ratio is relatively even, these out-migrants are primarily males, which leads to unbalanced ratios in some regions.<ref>[[#Neba|Neba]] 103–4.</ref>

Cameroon has one of the highest school attendance rates in Africa.<ref name=""Mbaku 15"" /> Girls attend school less regularly than boys do because of cultural attitudes, domestic duties, early marriage, pregnancy, and sexual harassment.

School attendance in Cameroon is also affected by [[child labour]].

===Music and dance===
{{further|Public holidays in Cameroon}}
[[File:Baka dancers June 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Dancers greet visitors to the East Region.]]

[[Music of Cameroon|Music]] and [[dance in Cameroon|dance]] are integral parts of Cameroonian ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings, and storytelling.<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 189</ref><ref name=""West 18""/> Traditional dances are highly choreographed and separate men and women or forbid participation by one sex altogether.<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 204.</ref> The dances' purposes range from pure entertainment to religious devotion.<ref name=""West 18"">[[#West|West]] 18.</ref> Traditionally, music is transmitted orally. In a typical performance, a chorus of singers echoes a soloist.<ref name=""Mbaku 189"">[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 189.</ref>

Musical accompaniment may be as simple as clapping hands and stamping feet,<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 191.</ref> but traditional instruments include bells worn by dancers, clappers, drums and [[talking drum]]s, flutes, horns, rattles, scrapers, stringed instruments, whistles, and xylophones; combinations of these vary by ethnic group and region. Some performers sing complete songs alone, accompanied by a harplike instrument.<ref name=""Mbaku 189""/><ref>[[#West|West]] 18–9.</ref>

Popular music styles include [[ambasse bey]] of the coast, [[assiko]] of the Bassa, [[mangambeu]] of the [[Bamileke|Bangangte]], and [[tsamassi]] of the Bamileke.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 184.</ref> [[Music of Nigeria|Nigerian music]] has influenced Anglophone Cameroonian performers, and [[Prince Nico Mbarga]]'s [[highlife]] hit ""[[Sweet Mother]]"" is the top-selling African record in history.<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 200.</ref>

The two most popular music styles are [[makossa]] and [[bikutsi]]. Makossa developed in Douala and mixes folk music, highlife, [[Soul music|soul]], and [[Soukous|Congo music]]. Performers such as [[Manu Dibango]], [[Francis Bebey]], [[Moni Bilé]], and [[Petit-Pays]] popularised the style worldwide in the 1970s and 1980s. Bikutsi originated as war music among the Ewondo. Artists such as [[Anne-Marie Nzié]] developed it into a popular dance music beginning in the 1940s, and performers such as [[Mama Ohandja]] and [[Les Têtes Brulées]] popularised it internationally during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 51</ref><ref name= Nkolo/>

===Holidays===
{{further|Public holidays in Cameroon}}
The most notable holiday associated with patriotism in Cameroon is [[National Day (Cameroon)|National Day]], also called Unity Day. Among the most notable religious holidays are [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption Day]], and [[Ascension Day]], which is typically 39 days after Easter. In the Northwest and Southwest provinces, collectively called [[Ambazonia]], October 1 is considered a national holiday, a date Ambazonians consider the day of their independence from Cameroon.<ref>Keke, Reginald Chikere. ""Southern Cameroons/Ambazonia Conflict: A Political Economy"", ''Theory & Event'' 23.2 (2020): 329–351.</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{further|Cameroonian cuisine}}
[[File:Ndolè à la viande, morue et crevettes.jpg|thumb|Plantains and ""Bobolo"" (made from cassava) served with Ndolè (meat and shrimp)]]
[[Cuisine of Cameroon|Cuisine]] varies by region, but a large, one-course, evening meal is common throughout the country. A typical dish is based on cocoyams, [[maize]], [[cassava]] (manioc), [[millet]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[potato]]es, [[rice]], or [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], often pounded into dough-like [[fufu]]. This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, [[Peanut|groundnut]]s, [[palm oil]], or other ingredients.<ref>[[#West|West]] 84–5.</ref> Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions, with chicken often reserved for special occasions.<ref name=""Mbaku 121-2"">[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 121–2.</ref> Dishes are often quite spicy; seasonings include salt, red pepper sauce, and [[maggi]].<ref>[[#Hudgens|Hudgens and Trillo]] 1047</ref><ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 122</ref><ref>[[#West|West]] 84.</ref>

Cutlery is common, but food is traditionally manipulated with the right hand. Breakfast consists of leftovers of bread and fruit with [[coffee]] or [[tea]]. Generally, breakfast is made from wheat flour in various different foods such as puff-puff (doughnuts), accra banana made from [[banana]]s and flour, bean cakes, and many more. Snacks are popular, especially in larger towns where they may be bought from [[street vendor]]s.<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 121</ref><ref>[[#Hudgens|Hudgens and Trillo]] 1049.</ref>

===Fashion===
[[File:Camerounais en tenue traditionnelle.jpg|thumb|upright|Cameroonian fashion is varied and often mixes modern and traditional elements. Note the wearing of [[sun glasses]], [[monk shoe]]s, [[sandals]], and a [[Smartwatch]].]]
Cameroon's relatively large and diverse population is likewise diverse in its fashions. Climate, religious, ethnic and cultural beliefs, and the influences of colonialism, imperialism, and globalization are all factors in contemporary Cameroonian dress.

Notable articles of clothing include: [[Pagnes]], [[sarong]]s worn by Cameroon women; [[Chechia]], a traditional hat; kwa, a male handbag; and [[Gandura]], male custom attire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cameroon-today.com/cameroon-clothing.html|title=Cameroon clothing – A description of the traditional attire of Cameroon.|website=Cameroon-Today.com|access-date=26 July 2020|archive-date=4 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804232108/https://www.cameroon-today.com/cameroon-clothing.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>
Wrappers and [[loincloths]] are used extensively by both women and men but their use varies by region, with influences from [[Fulani]] styles more present in the north and [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] styles more often in the south and west.<ref>Culture and Customs of Cameroon, 2000, pg. 135, by, John Mukum Mbaku</ref>

===Local arts and crafts===
[[File:Woman weaving baskets near Lake Ossa.jpg|thumb|A woman weaves a basket near [[Lake Ossa]], Littoral Region. Cameroonians practise such handicrafts throughout the country.]]
Traditional arts and crafts are practised throughout the country for commercial, decorative, and religious purposes. Woodcarvings and sculptures are especially common.<ref>[[#West|West]] 17.</ref> The high-quality clay of the western highlands is used for pottery and ceramics.<ref name=""West 18""/> Other crafts include [[basket weaving]], [[beadwork]]ing, brass and bronze working, [[calabash]] carving and painting, [[embroidery]], and [[Leather crafting|leather]] working. Traditional housing styles use local materials and vary from temporary wood-and-leaf shelters of nomadic [[Wodaabe|Mbororo]] to the rectangular mud-and-thatch homes of southern peoples. Dwellings of materials such as cement and tin are increasingly common.<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 110–3.</ref> [[Contemporary art]] is mainly promoted by independent cultural organizations ([[Doual'art]], [[Africréa]]) and [[artist-run initiative]]s ([[Art Wash]], [[Atelier Viking]], [[ArtBakery]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postzambia.com/post-read_article.php?articleId=8690|access-date=12 April 2013|work=The Post|author=Mulenga, Andrew|date=30 April 2010|title=Cameroon's indomitable contemporary art|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311124956/http://www.postzambia.com/post-read_article.php?articleId=8690|archive-date=11 March 2014}}</ref>

===Literature===
{{main|Literature of Cameroon}}
Cameroonian literature has concentrated on both European and African themes. Colonial-era writers such as [[Louis-Marie Pouka]] and [[Sankie Maimo]] were educated by European missionary societies and advocated [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into European culture to bring Cameroon into the modern world.<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 80–1</ref> After [[World War II]], writers such as [[Mongo Beti]] and [[Ferdinand Oyono]] analysed and criticised colonialism and rejected assimilation.<ref name=Fitzpatrick/><ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 77, 83–4</ref><ref name=Volet/>

===Films and literature===
{{further|Cinema of Cameroon}}
Shortly after independence, filmmakers such as [[Jean-Paul Ngassa]] and [[Thérèse Sita-Bella]] explored similar themes.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 119–120</ref><ref>[[#West|West]] 20.</ref> In the 1960s, [[Mongo Beti]], [[Ferdinand Léopold Oyono]] and other writers explored postcolonialism, problems of African development, and the recovery of African identity.<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 85–6.</ref> In the mid-1970s, filmmakers such as [[Jean-Pierre Dikongué Pipa]] and [[Daniel Kamwa]] dealt with the conflicts between traditional and postcolonial society. Literature and films during the next two decades focused more on wholly Cameroonian themes.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 120.</ref>

===Sports===
{{main|Sport in Cameroon}}
[[File:Cameroon vs Germany 2003.jpg|thumb|[[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] faces [[Germany national football team|Germany]] at [[Zentralstadion]] in Leipzig, 17 November 2004]]
National policy strongly advocates sport in all forms.

Sport in Cameroon is dominated by football. Amateur football clubs abound, organised along ethnic lines or under corporate sponsors. The [[Cameroon national football team|national team]] has been one of the most successful in Africa since its strong showing in the [[1982 Football World Cup|1982]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]s. Cameroon has won five [[African Cup of Nations]] titles and the gold medal at the [[Football at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2000 Olympics]].<ref>[[#West|West]] 92–93, 127.</ref>

'''Cape Verde''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-Cape Verde.ogg|ˈ|v|ɜːr|d|(|i|)}}, {{respell|VURD}} or {{respell|VUR|dee}}) or '''Cabo Verde''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-Cabo Verde-pronunciation.ogg|ˌ|k|ɑː|b|oʊ|_|ˈ|v|ɜːr|d|eɪ}}, {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|b|-}} {{respell|KA(H)B|oh|_|VUR|day}}; {{IPA-pt|ˈkaβu ˈveɾðɨ|lang}}), officially the '''Republic of Cabo Verde''', is an [[archipelago]] and [[island country]] of [[West Africa]] in the central Atlantic Ocean, consisting of ten [[volcanic island]]s with a combined land area of about {{convert|4033|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name=""NameNatGeo"">{{cite magazine |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/12/131212-maps-cabo-verde-cartography-science-cape-verde-africa/ |title=Cape Verde Gets New Name: 5 Things to Know About How Maps Change |author=Tanya Basu |magazine=National Geographic |date=12 December 2013 |access-date=12 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213044150/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/12/131212-maps-cabo-verde-cartography-science-cape-verde-africa/ |archive-date=13 December 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> These islands lie between {{convert|600|and|850|km|nmi|abbr=off}} west of [[Cap-Vert]], the westernmost point of continental Africa. The [[List of islands of Cape Verde|Cape Verde islands]] form part of the [[Macaronesia]] [[ecoregion]], along with the [[Azores]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[Madeira]], and the [[Savage Isles]].

The Cape Verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century, when [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] explorers discovered and [[Colony|colonized]] the islands, thus establishing the first European settlement in the tropics. Because the Cape Verde islands were conveniently located to play a role in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], Cape Verde became economically prosperous during the 16th and 17th centuries, attracting merchants, [[privateer]]s, and [[Piracy|pirates]]. It declined economically in the 19th century after the suppression of the Atlantic slave trade, and many of its inhabitants emigrated during that period. However, Cape Verde gradually recovered economically by becoming an important commercial center and useful stopover point along major shipping routes. Cape Verde became independent in 1975.

Since the early 1990s, Cape Verde has been a stable [[representative democracy]] and has remained one of the most developed and democratic countries in Africa. Lacking natural resources, its developing economy is mostly service-oriented, with a growing focus on [[tourism]] and foreign investment. Its population of around 483,628 ({{as of | 2021 | alt = as of the 2021 Census}}) is of mostly African and a minor European heritage, and predominantly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], reflecting the legacy of Portuguese rule. A sizeable [[Cape Verdean diaspora]] community exists across the world, especially in the United States and Portugal, considerably outnumbering the inhabitants on the islands. Cape Verde is a member state of the [[African Union]].

== Etymology ==
The country is named after the [[Cap-Vert]] peninsula, on the [[Senegal]]ese coast.<ref>Lobban, [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8KA40g7vnQC&pg=PA4 p. 4] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125001356/https://books.google.com/books?id=K8KA40g7vnQC&pg=PA4 |date=25 January 2016 }}</ref> The name ''Cap-Vert'', in turn, comes from the [[Portuguese language]] {{Lang|pt|Cabo Verde}} ('green cape'), the name that Portuguese explorers gave the cape in 1444, a few years before they came across the islands.

On 24 October 2013, the country's delegation to the United Nations informed it that other countries should no longer use ''Cape Verde'' or any other translations of ''Cabo Verde'' as part of its official name: all countries should use ''Republic of Cabo Verde'' as the country's official name.<ref name=""NameNatGeo"" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Cabo Verde põe fim à tradução da sua designação oficial |url=http://www.panapress.com/Cabo-Verde-poe-fim-a-traducao-da-sua-designacao-oficial--3-885656-47-lang4-index.html |date=31 October 2013 |access-date=17 December 2013 |publisher=Panapress |language=pt |trans-title=Cabo Verde puts an end to translation of its official designation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217224228/http://www.panapress.com/Cabo-Verde-poe-fim-a-traducao-da-sua-designacao-oficial--3-885656-47-lang4-index.html |archive-date=17 December 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Speakers of English have used the name ''Cape Verde'' for the archipelago and, since independence in 1975, for the country. In 2013, the Cape Verdean government determined that it would thenceforth use the Portuguese name {{Lang|pt|Cabo Verde}} for official purposes, including at the [[United Nations]], even when speaking or writing in English.<!-- The name used in this article should not be changed unless and until there is a consensus to do so, based on changes in general English-language usage.

[[File:Insulae Capitis viridis-1598.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''Insulae Capitis Viridis'' (1598), showing Cape Verde]]
The archipelago of modern-day Cape Verde was formed approximately 40–50 million years ago during the [[Eocene]] era.

Before the arrival of Europeans, the Cape Verde Islands were uninhabited.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cabo Verde – Cultural life |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Cabo-Verde/Cultural-life#ref516606 |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en |quote=Although there is no conclusive evidence that the islands were inhabited before the arrival of the Portuguese, cases may be made for visits by Phoenicians, Moors, and Africans in previous centuries. |access-date=17 May 2021 |archive-date=17 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210517175902/https://www.britannica.com/place/Cabo-Verde/Cultural-life#ref516606 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cape Verde, Country on the West Coast of Africa {{!}} South African History Online |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/place/cape-verde-country-west-coast-africa |website=South Africa History Online |quote=The early settlement in Cape Verde by Arab and African fishermen has only been related through oral history, and remains a part of the mythological stories of origin of the archipelago.

According to Portuguese official records,<ref>''Carta regia'' (royal letter) of 19 September 1462</ref> the first discoveries were made by Genoa-born [[António de Noli]], who was afterwards appointed governor of Cape Verde by the Portuguese king [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]]. Other navigators mentioned as contributing to discoveries on the Cape Verde archipelago are [[Diogo Dias]], Diogo Afonso, [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[Alvise Cadamosto]], and [[Diogo Gomes]] (who had accompanied António de Noli on his voyage of discovery, and who claimed to have been the first to land on the Cape Verdean island of Santiago, and the first to name that island).

In 1462, Portuguese settlers arrived at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] and founded a settlement they called Ribeira Grande. Today it is called [[Cidade Velha]] (""Old City""), to distinguish it from a town of the same name on a different Cape Verdean island ([[Ribeira Grande, Cape Verde|Ribeira Grande]] on the island of [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santo Antão]]). The original Ribeira Grande was the first permanent European settlement in the [[tropics]].<ref name=bn>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2835.htm Cape Verde background note] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604183534/https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2835.htm |date=4 June 2019 }} .

In the 16th century, the archipelago prospered from the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref name=bn /> Pirates occasionally attacked the Portuguese settlements. [[Francis Drake]], an English [[privateer]], twice sacked the (then) capital Ribeira Grande in 1585 when it was a part of the [[Iberian Union]].<ref name=bn /> After a French attack in 1712, the town declined in importance relative to nearby [[Praia]], which became the capital in 1770.<ref name=bn />

The decline in the slave trade in the 19th century resulted in an economic crisis. Cape Verde's early prosperity slowly vanished. However, the islands' position astride mid-Atlantic shipping lanes made Cape Verde an ideal location for re-supplying ships. Because of its excellent harbour, the city of [[Mindelo]], located on the island of [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|São Vicente]], became an important commercial centre during the 19th century.<ref name=bn /> Diplomat [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]] visited Cape Verde in 1832.<ref name=Roberts>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=Edmund |title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat |year=1837 |publisher=Harper & Brothers |location=New York |page=17 |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/17/ |access-date=10 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109011955/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/17/ |archive-date=9 November 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Cape Verde was the first stop of [[Charles Darwin]]'s voyage with {{HMS|Beagle}} in 1832.<ref>[[s:en:Journal of researches into the natural history and geology of the countries visited during the voyage of H.M.S.

With few natural resources and inadequate sustainable investment from the Portuguese, the citizens grew increasingly discontented with the colonial masters, who refused to provide the local authorities with more autonomy. In 1951, Portugal changed Cape Verde's status from a colony to an overseas province in an attempt to blunt growing [[nationalism]].<ref name=""bn"" />

In 1956, [[Amílcar Cabral]] and a group of fellow Cape Verdeans and Guineans organized (in [[Portuguese Guinea]]) the clandestine [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC).<ref name=bn /> It demanded improvement in economic, social and political conditions in Cape Verde and Portuguese Guinea and formed the basis of the two nations' independence movement. Moving its headquarters to [[Conakry]], Guinea in 1960, the PAIGC began an armed rebellion against Portugal in 1961. Acts of sabotage eventually grew into a [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence|war in Portuguese Guinea]] that pitted 10,000 [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]]-supported PAIGC soldiers against 35,000 Portuguese and African troops.<ref name=bn />

By 1972, the PAIGC controlled much of Portuguese Guinea despite the presence of the Portuguese troops, but the organization did not attempt to disrupt Portuguese control in Cape Verde. Portuguese Guinea declared independence in 1973 and was granted [[de jure]] independence in 1974. A budding independence movement&nbsp;– originally led by [[Amílcar Cabral]], assassinated in 1973&nbsp;– passed on to his half-brother [[Luís Cabral]] and culminated in independence for the archipelago in 1975.

=== Independence (1975) ===
Following the [[Carnation Revolution|April 1974 revolution in Portugal]], the PAIGC became an active political movement in Cape Verde. In December 1974, the PAIGC and Portugal signed an agreement providing for a transitional government composed of Portuguese and Cape Verdeans. On 30 June 1975, Cape Verdeans elected a National Assembly which received the instruments of independence from Portugal on 5 July 1975.<ref name=bn /> In the late 1970s and 1980s, most African countries prohibited [[South African Airways]] from overflights but Cape Verde allowed them and became a centre of activity for the airline's flights to Europe and the United States.

Immediately following the [[1980 Guinea-Bissau coup d'état|November 1980 coup in Guinea-Bissau]], relations between Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau became strained. Cape Verde abandoned its hope for unity with Guinea-Bissau and formed the [[African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde]] (PAICV). Problems have since been resolved and [[Cape Verde–Guinea-Bissau relations|relations between the countries]] are good. The PAICV and its predecessor established a one-party system and ruled Cape Verde from independence until 1990.<ref name=bn />

Responding to growing pressure for pluralistic democracy, the PAICV called an emergency congress in February 1990 to discuss proposed constitutional changes to end one-party rule. Opposition groups came together to form the [[Movement for Democracy (Cape Verde)|Movement for Democracy]] (MpD) in Praia in April 1990. Together, they campaigned for the right to contest the presidential election scheduled for December 1990.

The one-party state was abolished on 28 September 1990, and the first multi-party elections were held in January 1991. The MpD won a majority of the seats in the National Assembly, and MpD presidential candidate [[António Mascarenhas Monteiro]] defeated the PAICV's candidate with 73.5% of the votes. Legislative elections in December 1995 increased the MpD majority in the National Assembly. The party won 50 of the National Assembly's 72 seats.

A February 1996 presidential election returned President Monteiro to office. Legislative elections in January 2001 returned power to the PAICV, with the PAICV holding 40 of the National Assembly seats, MpD 30, and [[Party for Democratic Convergence]] (PCD) and [[Labour and Solidarity Party]] (PTS) 1 each. In February 2001, the PAICV-supported presidential candidate [[Pedro Pires]] defeated former MpD leader [[Carlos Veiga]] by only 13 votes.<ref name=bn /> <ref>{{cite web |title=Pedro Pires wins Cape Verde runoff |url=https://eu.southcoasttoday.com/story/news/2001/03/09/pedro-pires-wins-cape-verde/50302563007/ |website=New Bedford Standard-Times |access-date=8 June 2023 |archive-date=7 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230807060451/https://www.southcoasttoday.com/story/news/2001/03/09/pedro-pires-wins-cape-verde/50302563007/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Cape Verdean Armed Forces|military of Cape Verde]] consists of the National Guard and the Coast Guard; 0.7% of the country's GDP was spent on the military in 2005.

Having fought their only battles in the war for independence against Portugal between 1974 and 1975, the efforts of the Cape Verdean armed forces have turned to combating international drug trafficking. In 2007, together with the [[Law enforcement in Cape Verde|Cape Verdean Police]], they carried out Operation Flying Launch ({{Lang|pt|Operacão Lancha Voadora}}), a successful operation to put an end to a drug trafficking group which smuggled cocaine from Colombia to the Netherlands and Germany using the country as a reorder point. The operation took more than three years, being a secret operation during the first two years, and ended in 2010. In 2016, Cape Verdean Armed Forces were involved in the [[Monte Tchota massacre]], a green-on-green incident that resulted in 11 deaths.<ref>{{Cite news |date=27 April 2016 |title=Eleven shot dead in Cape Verde, including two Spanish citizens |newspaper=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-capeverde-killings-idUSKCN0XN2LA |url-status=live |access-date=28 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427142548/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-capeverde-killings-idUSKCN0XN2LA |archive-date=27 April 2016}}</ref>

The Cape Verde archipelago is in the Atlantic Ocean, approximately {{convert|570|km|mi}} off the western coast of the African continent, near Senegal, The Gambia, and [[Mauritania]] as well as part of the [[Macaronesia]] [[ecoregion]]. It lies between latitudes [[14th parallel north|14°]] and [[18th parallel north|18°N]], and longitudes [[22nd meridian west|22°]] and [[26th meridian west|26°W]].

The country is a horseshoe-shaped cluster of ten islands (nine inhabited) and eight islets,<ref name=pc>{{cite web |url=http://www.peacecorps.gov/welcomebooks/cvwb655.pdf |title=The Peace Corps Welcomes You to Cape Verde |publisher=[[Peace Corps]] |date=April 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427225315/http://files.peacecorps.gov/manuals/welcomebooks/cvwb655.pdf |archive-date=27 April 2017 |url-status=dead}} ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref> that constitute an area of 4033&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (1557 sq mi).<ref name=pc />

The islands are spatially divided into two groups:
*The [[Barlavento Islands]] ([[Windward and leeward|windward]] islands): [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santo Antão]], [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|São Vicente]], [[Santa Luzia, Cape Verde|Santa Luzia]], [[São Nicolau, Cape Verde|São Nicolau]], [[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal]], [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]];<ref name=pc /> and
*The [[Sotavento Islands]] ([[Windward and leeward|leeward]]): [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio]], [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]], [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]], [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]].<ref name=pc />
The largest island, both in size and population, is Santiago, which hosts the nation's capital, Praia, the principal urban agglomeration in the archipelago.<ref name=pc />

Three of the Cape Verde islands, Sal, Boa Vista, and Maio, are fairly flat, sandy, and dry; the others are generally rockier with more vegetation.

[[File:Boa Vista IMG 3886 25.jpg|thumb|Beach east of [[Curral Velho, Cape Verde|Curral Velho]], [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]]]]
Geologically, the islands, covering a combined area of slightly over {{convert|4,033|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}}, are principally composed of [[igneous rock]]s, with volcanic structures and [[Pyroclastic rock|pyroclastic]] debris comprising the majority of the archipelago's total volume. The [[Volcano|volcanic]] and [[pluton]]ic rocks are distinctly basic; the archipelago is a soda-alkaline [[Petrography|petrographic]] province, with a [[Petrology|petrologic]] succession similar to that found in other Macaronesian islands.

Magnetic anomalies identified in the vicinity of the archipelago indicate that the structures forming the islands date back 125–150 million years: the islands themselves date from 8 million (in the west) to 20 million years (in the east).<ref name=""Pim et al., 2008, p.422"">Pim et al., 2008, p. 422</ref> The oldest exposed rocks occurred on Maio and the northern peninsula of Santiago and are 128–131 million-year-old pillow lavas. The first stage of volcanism in the islands began in the early [[Miocene]], and reached its peak at the end of this period when the islands reached their maximum sizes. Historical volcanism (within human settlement) has been restricted to the island of Fogo.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Carracedo |first1=Juan Carlos |title=North-East Atlantic Islands: The Macaronesian Archipelagos |date=2021 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102908-4.00027-8 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geology |pages=674–699 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-102909-1 |access-date=2021-03-16 |last2=Troll |first2=Valentin R. |doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-102908-4.00027-8 |s2cid=226588940 |archive-date=7 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230807060431/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780081029084000278?via%3Dihub |url-status=live }}</ref>

The islands lie on a bathymetric swell known as the [[Cape Verde Rise]].<ref>R. Ramalho et al., 2010</ref> The Rise is one of the largest protuberances in the world's oceans, rising {{convert|2.2|km|mi|1|abbr=off}} in a semi-circular region of 1200&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (460 sq mi), associated with a rise of the [[geoid]].<ref name=""Pim et al., 2008, p.422"" />

[[Pico do Fogo]], the largest active volcano in the region, erupted in 2014. It has an {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=off|spell=on|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[caldera]], the rim of which is at an elevation of {{convert|1,600|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} and an interior cone that rises to {{convert|2,829|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]. The caldera resulted from subsidence, following the partial evacuation (eruption) of the [[magma]] chamber, along a cylindrical column from within the magma chamber (at a depth of {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=off}}).

=== Climate ===
{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2018}}<!-- no citations after the table -->
{{Further|Geography of Cape Verde#Climate}}
Cape Verde's climate is milder than that of the African mainland because the surrounding sea moderates temperatures on the islands and cold Atlantic currents produce an arid atmosphere around the archipelago. Conversely, the islands do not receive the [[upwelling]] (cold streams) that affect the West African coast, so the air temperature is cooler than in Senegal, but the sea is warmer. Due to the relief of some islands, such as Santiago with its steep mountains, the islands can have [[Orographic lift|orographically]] induced precipitation, allowing rich woods and luxuriant vegetation to grow where the humid air condenses soaking the plants, rocks, soil, logs, moss, etc. On the higher islands and somewhat wetter islands, exclusively in mountainous areas, like Santo Antão island, the climate is suitable for the development of dry monsoon forests, and [[laurel forest]]s.<ref name=pc /> Average temperatures range from {{convert|22|C}} in February to {{convert|27|C|1}} in September.<ref name=""inmg"" /> Cape Verde is part of the [[Sahel]]ian arid belt, with nothing like the rainfall levels of nearby [[West Africa]].<ref name=pc /> It rains irregularly between August and October, with frequent brief heavy downpours.<ref name=pc /> A [[desert]] is usually defined as terrain that receives less than {{cvt|250|mm|in|1}} of annual rainfall. Sal's total of {{cvt|145|mm|in|1}} confirms this classification. Most of the year's rain falls in September.<ref name=""inmg"" />

Sal, Boa Vista, and Maio have a flat landscape and arid climate, whilst the other islands are generally rockier and have more vegetation. Because of the infrequent occurrence of rainfall, where not mountainous, the landscape is so arid that less than two percent of it is arable.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Halter |first1=Marilyn |editor1-last=Barkan |editor1-first=Elliott Robert |title=Immigrants in American History: Arrival, Adaptation, and Integration, Volume 1 |date=2013 |publisher=ABC-CLIO Publisher |page=269 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AP7QCteb0o0C&q=Cape+Verde |chapter=Cape Verdeans and Cape Verdean Americans, 1870–1940 |isbn=978-1-59884-219-7 |quote=The Cape Verde Islands...chain...was named after the westernmost tip of mainland Africa, the Cape Vert, and[,] while the term ""Verde"" (green) gives the impression of a lush and verdant landscape, nothing could be further from the truth.

Most rainfall precipitation is due to condensation of the ocean mist.

[[File:Ribeira Principal (1).jpg|thumb|The small valley (or dale) of Principal, [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago Island]]]]
In some islands, like Santiago, the wetter climate of the interior and the eastern coast contrasts with the drier one on the south/southwest coast. Praia, on the southeast coast, is the largest city on the island and the largest city and capital of the country.

While most of Cape Verde receives little precipitation throughout the year, the northeastern slopes of high mountains see significant rainfall due to orographic lift, especially in areas far from the sea. In some such areas this precipitation is sufficient to support a rainforest habitat, albeit one significantly affected by the islands' human presence. These umbria areas are identified as cool and moist. Cape Verde lies in the [[Cape Verde Islands dry forests]] ecoregion.<ref name=""DinersteinOlson2017"">{{cite journal |last1=Dinerstein |first1=Eric |last2=Olson |first2=David |last3=Joshi |first3=Anup |last4=Vynne |first4=Carly |last5=Burgess |first5=Neil D. |last6=Wikramanayake |first6=Eric |last7=Hahn |first7=Nathan |last8=Palminteri |first8=Suzanne |last9=Hedao |first9=Prashant|last10=Noss|first10=Reed |last11=Hansen |first11=Matt |last12=Locke |first12=Harvey |last13=Ellis |first13=Erle C |last14=Jones |first14=Benjamin |last15=Barber |first15=Charles Victor |last16=Hayes |first16=Randy |last17=Kormos |first17=Cyril |last18=Martin |first18=Vance |last19=Crist |first19=Eileen|last20=Sechrest|first20=Wes |last21=Price |first21=Lori |last22=Baillie |first22=Jonathan E.

Western Hemisphere-bound hurricanes often have their early beginnings near the Cape Verde Islands. These are referred to as [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]]s. These hurricanes can become very intense as they cross warm Atlantic waters away from Cape Verde. The average hurricane season has about two Cape Verde-type hurricanes, which are usually the largest and most intense storms of the season because they often have plenty of warm open ocean over which to develop before encountering land. The five largest Atlantic tropical cyclones on record have been Cape Verde-type hurricanes. Most of the longest-lived tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin are Cape Verde hurricanes.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

As of 2015, the islands themselves have only been struck by hurricanes twice in recorded history (since 1851): once in 1892, and again in 2015 by [[Hurricane Fred (2015)|Hurricane Fred]], the easternmost hurricane ever to form in the Atlantic.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

=== Biodiversity ===
{{Main|Wildlife of Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands dry forests}}
Cape Verde's isolation has resulted in the islands having several [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] [[species]], particularly birds and reptiles, many of which are [[endangered species|endangered]] by human development. Endemic birds include [[Alexander's swift]] (''Apus alexandri''), [[Bourne's heron]] (''Ardea purpurea bournei''), the [[Raso lark]] (''Alauda razae''), the [[Cape Verde warbler]] (''Acrocephalus brevipennis''), and the [[Iago sparrow]] (''Passer iagoensis'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/ebas/index.html?action=EbaHTMDetails.asp&sid=79&m=0 |title=Endemic Bird Areas: Cape Verde Islands |website=Birdlife.org |access-date=26 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102230740/http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/ebas/index.html?action=EbaHTMDetails.asp&sid=79&m=0 |archive-date=2 January 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> The islands are also an important breeding area for seabirds including the [[Cape Verde shearwater]]. Reptiles include the Cape Verde giant gecko (''[[Tarentola gigas]]'').

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Cape Verde}}

Cape Verde is divided into 22 [[Municipality|municipalities]] ({{Lang|pt|concelhos}}) and subdivided into 32 parishes (''[[Freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]''), based on the religious parishes that existed during the colonial period:

Cape Verde's notable economic growth and improvement in living conditions despite a lack of natural resources have garnered [[#International recognition|international recognition]], with other countries and international organizations often providing [[development aid]]. Since 2007, the UN has classified it as a [[developing nation]] rather than a [[least developed country]].

Cape Verde has few [[natural resource]]s. Only five of the ten main islands (Santiago, Santo Antão, São Nicolau, Fogo, and Brava) normally support significant agricultural production,<ref>See Carlos Ferreira Couto, ''Incerteza, adaptabilidade e inovação na sociedade rural da Ilha de Santiago de Cabo Verde'', Lisbon: Fundação Galouste Gulbenkian, 2010</ref> and over 90% of all food consumed in Cape Verde is imported. Mineral resources include salt, [[pozzolana]] (a volcanic rock used in cement production), and [[limestone]].<ref name=bn /> Its small number of wineries making Portuguese-style wines have traditionally focused on the domestic market, but have recently met with some international acclaim. Several wine tours of Cape Verde's various microclimates began to be offered in spring 2010.

The economy of Cape Verde is service-oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for more than 70% of GDP.{{cn|date=January 2023}} Although nearly 35% of the population lives in rural areas, agriculture and fishing contribute only about 9% of GDP. Light manufacturing accounts for most of the remainder. Fish and shellfish are plentiful, and small quantities are exported. Cape Verde has cold storage and freezing facilities and [[fish processing]] plants in Mindelo, Praia, and on Sal. Expatriate Cape Verdeans contribute an amount estimated at 20% of GDP to the domestic economy through [[remittance]]s.<ref name=bn />
Despite having few natural resources and being semi-desert, the country boasts the highest living standards in the region and has attracted thousands of immigrants of different nationalities.

Since 1991, the government has pursued market-oriented economic policies, including an open welcome to [[foreign investors]] and a far-reaching [[privatization]] programme. It established as top development priorities the promotion of a [[market economy]] and the private sector; the development of [[Tourism in Cape Verde|tourism]], light manufacturing industries, and fisheries; and the development of [[Transport in Cape Verde|transport]], [[Communications in Cape Verde|communications]], and energy facilities. From 1994 to 2000 about $407 million in foreign investments were made or planned, of which 58% were in tourism,<ref>See now Brígida Rocha Brito and others, ''Turismo em Meio Insular Africano: Potencialidades, constrangimentos e impactos'', Lisbon: Gerpress, 2010</ref> 17% in industry, 4% in infrastructure, and 21% in fisheries and services.<ref name=bn />

In 2011, on four islands a wind farm was built that supplies about 30% of the electricity of the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infracoafrica.com/news.asp?id=11 |title=Turbines arrive for ground-breaking wind farm in Africa&nbsp;– InfraCo Limited |website=Infracoafrica.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092910/http://www.infracoafrica.com/news.asp?id=11 |archive-date=11 June 2012}}</ref>
As host to the [[ECOWAS]] Regional Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, inaugurated in 2010, Cape Verde plans to lead by example by becoming entirely reliant on renewable energy sources by 2025.<ref name=""UNESCO Science Report 2021"">{{cite book |editor1-last=Schneegans |editor1-first=S. |editor2-last=Straza |editor2-first=T. |editor3-last=Lewis |editor3-first=J. |title=UNESCO Science Report: the Race Against Time for Smarter Development. |date=2021 |publisher=UNESCO |location=Paris |isbn=978-92-3-100450-6 |url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000377433/PDF/377433eng.pdf.multi |access-date=9 September 2021 |archive-date=18 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220618233752/https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000377433/PDF/377433eng.pdf.multi |url-status=live }}</ref> This policy is consistent with the plethora of documents adopted in 2015 paving the way to more sustainable development, including Cape Verde's ''Transformational Agenda to 2030'', its ''National Renewable Energy Plan'' and its ''Low Carbon and Climate-resilient Development Strategy''. Two years later, these were followed by a ''Strategic Plan for Sustainable Development, 2017–2021''.<ref name=""UNESCO Science Report 2021""/>

Between 2000 and 2009, [[real GDP]] increased on average by over seven percent a year, well above the average for Sub-Saharan countries and faster than most small island economies in the region. Strong economic performance was bolstered by one of the fastest growing tourism industries in the world, as well as by substantial capital inflows that allowed Cape Verde to build up national currency reserves to the current 3.5 months of imports. Unemployment has been falling rapidly, and the country is on track to achieve most of the UN Millennium Development Goals – including halving its 1990 poverty level.

In 2007, Cape Verde joined the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and in 2008 the country graduated from Least Developed Country (LDC) to Middle Income Country (MIC) status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfw4a.org/cape-verde/cape-verde-financial-sector-profile.html |title=MFW4A |website=MFW4A |access-date=31 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513110352/http://www.mfw4a.org/cape-verde/cape-verde-financial-sector-profile.html |archive-date=13 May 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/cape-verde |title=Cabo Verde – Data |publisher=[[World Bank]] |access-date=22 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811164323/http://data.worldbank.org/country/cape-verde |archive-date=11 August 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Cape Verde has significant cooperation with Portugal at every level of the economy, which has led it to link its currency first to the [[Portuguese escudo]] and, in 1999, to the euro. On 23 June 2008 Cape Verde became the 153rd member of the WTO.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news08_e/acc_capverde_june08_e.htm |title=Cape Verde to join WTO on 23 July 2008 |publisher=WTO News |access-date=4 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708091440/http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news08_e/acc_capverde_june08_e.htm |archive-date=8 July 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Development ===
The [[European Commission]]'s total allocation for the period of 2008–2013 foreseen for Cape Verde to address ""poverty reduction, in particular in rural and peri-urban areas where women are heading the households, as well as good governance"" amounts to €54.1 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/where/acp/country-cooperation/cape-verde/cape-verde_en.htm |title=European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=21 December 2012 |access-date=28 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430214342/http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/where/acp/country-cooperation/cape-verde/cape-verde_en.htm |archive-date=30 April 2013}}</ref>

=== Tourism ===
{{Main|Tourism in Cape Verde}}
[[File:Mindelo portogrande.jpg|thumb|Yachts in Porto Grande, Mindelo, on the island of [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|São Vicente]]. Tourism is a growing source of income on the islands.]]
Cape Verde's strategic location at the crossroads of mid-Atlantic air and sea lanes has been enhanced by significant improvements at Mindelo's harbour ([[Porto Grande Bay|Porto Grande]]) and at [[Amílcar Cabral International Airport|Sal's]] and [[Nelson Mandela International Airport|Praia's international airports]]. A [[Aristides Pereira International Airport|new international airport]] was opened in Boa Vista in December 2007 and on the island of São Vicente, the newest international airport ([[Cesária Évora Airport]]) in Cape Verde was opened in late 2009. Ship repair facilities at Mindelo were opened in 1983.<ref name=bn />

The major ports are Mindelo and Praia, but all other islands have smaller port facilities. In addition to the international airport on Sal, [[List of airports in Cape Verde|airports]] have been built on all of the inhabited islands. All but the airports on Brava and Santo Antão enjoy scheduled air service. The archipelago has {{cvt|3050|km|mi|0}} of roads, of which {{cvt|1010|km|mi|0}} are paved, most using [[cobblestone]].<ref name=bn />

The country's future economic prospects depend heavily on the maintenance of aid flows, the encouragement of tourism, remittances, outsourcing labour to neighbouring African countries, and the momentum of the government's development programme.<ref name=bn />

The official Census recorded that Cape Verde had a population of 512,096 in 2013.<ref>Instituto Nacional de Estatistica, Praia</ref> A large proportion (236,000) of Cape Verdeans live on the main island, Santiago.<ref name=cvp>{{cite web |title=Cape Verde: Population |url=http://www.capeverde.com/population.html |publisher=caperverde.com |access-date=29 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114140611/http://www.capeverde.com/population.html |archive-date=14 November 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Cape Verdeans are descendants of Africans (free or enslaved) and Europeans of various origins. There are also Cape Verdeans who have Jewish ancestors from North Africa, mainly on the islands of Boa Vista, Santiago and Santo Antão. A large part of Cape Verdeans emigrated abroad, mainly to the United States, Portugal and France, so that there are more Cape Verdeans residing abroad than at home.

Unlike countries on the African continent, there are no tribes in Cape Verde. On the other hand, the country's historical trajectory included, from the beginning, a process of social class formation. At this moment, the absence of a ""bourgeoisie"" can be seen, but the existence of several types of ""petty bourgeoisie"", numerically significant. The majority of the population is, however, made up of the peasantry and some working class.<ref>{{cite news |date= |title=Michel Lesourd, État et société aux îles du Cap Vert, Paris: Karthala, 1995 |work= |url=}}</ref>{{Largest cities

It is also used in newspapers, television, and radio.

[[Cape Verdean Creole]] ({{Lang|kea|Kriolu}}) is used colloquially throughout Cape Verde and is the mother tongue of virtually all Cape Verdeans. The national constitution calls for measures to give it parity with Portuguese.<ref name="":0"" /> There is a substantial body of literature in Creole, especially in the [[Santiago Creole]] and the [[São Vicente Creole]]. {{Lang|kea|Kriolu}} has been gaining prestige since the nation's independence from Portugal.

The differences between the forms of the language within the islands have been a major obstacle in the way of standardization of the language. Some people have advocated the development of two standards: a North (Barlavento) standard, centred on the São Vicente Creole, and a South (Sotavento) standard, centred on the Santiago Creole. [[Manuel Veiga (writer)|Manuel Veiga]], Ph.D., a linguist and Minister of Culture of Cape Verde, is the premier proponent of {{Lang|kea|Kriolu}}''<nowiki/>'s'' officialization and standardization.<ref>Amado, Abel D.

The vast majority of Cape Verdeans are Christian; reflecting centuries of Portuguese rule, Roman Catholics make up the single largest religious community, at just under 80 percent, as of 2010 (slightly down from 85 percent of the population in 2007).<ref name=rf>{{cite web |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90087.htm |title=State.gov |publisher=State.gov |date=14 September 2007 |access-date=26 June 2010 |archive-date=7 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191007025617/https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90087.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Most other religious groups are [[Protestant]], with the evangelical [[Church of the Nazarene]] forming the second largest community; other sizeable denominations are the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the [[Assemblies of God]], the [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]] and [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Cape Verde|the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].<ref name=""rf"" /> [[Muslim|Islam]] is the largest minority religion.<ref name=""rf"" /> [[History of the Jews in Cape Verde|Judaism]] had a historical presence during the colonial era.<ref>""[http://www1.umassd.edu/specialprograms/caboverde/jewswerlin.html Jews in Cape Verde] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408121318/http://www1.umassd.edu/SpecialPrograms/caboverde/jewswerlin.html |date=8 April 2015 }}"", by Louise Werlin</ref> [[Atheists]] constitute less than 1 percent of the population.<ref name=""rf"" /> Many Cape Verdeans [[syncretism|syncretize]] Christianity with [[Traditional African religions|indigenous African beliefs and customs]].<ref name=""factbook"">{{cite web |date=15 June 2010 |title=Background Note: Cape Verde |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2835.htm |access-date=26 June 2010 |publisher=State.gov |archive-date=4 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604183534/https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2835.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Emigration and immigration ===
{{Main|Cape Verdean diaspora}}
[[File:Ministério da Cultura - Claridalia (18).jpg|thumb|People in [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]], the largest island in the country]]
Almost twice as many Cape Verdeans live abroad (nearly one million) than in the country itself.<ref>Jorgen Carling, 2004, pp. 113–132</ref> The islands have a long history of emigration and Cape Verdeans are highly dispersed worldwide, from [[Macau]] to [[Haiti]] and Argentina to Sweden.<ref>{{citation |title=Cape Verdean Americans&nbsp;– History, Modern era, The first cape verdeans in america |publisher=Everyculture.com}}</ref> The diaspora may be much larger than official statistics indicate, as, until independence in 1975, Cape Verdean immigrants had Portuguese passports.

The majority of Cape Verdeans live in the United States and Western Europe, with the former hosting the largest overseas population at 500,000. Most Cape Verdeans in the U.S. are concentrated in [[New England]], particularly the cities of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]], and [[Boston]]; [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]], has the largest community of any American city (18,832).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bostonplans.org/getattachment/6bf8a841-63b7-4a53-90bb-94989f41117e |title=Cape Verdeans in Brockton |website=Boston Planning & Development Agency |access-date=7 September 2019 |archive-date=1 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220401014912/https://www.bostonplans.org/getattachment/6bf8a841-63b7-4a53-90bb-94989f41117e |url-status=live }}</ref> 

Cape Verdeans have been migrating to [[Massachusetts]] since the 1840s, but most of the current population arrived in the 1970s.<ref name="":3"">{{Cite web |date=2019-05-28 |title=A History of Immigration to Boston: Eras, Ethnic Groups, and Places |url=https://brewminate.com/a-history-of-immigration-to-boston-eras-ethnic-groups-and-places/ |access-date=2023-04-15 |website=Brewminate: A Bold Blend of News and Ideas |language=en-US |archive-date=15 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230415182523/https://brewminate.com/a-history-of-immigration-to-boston-eras-ethnic-groups-and-places/ |url-status=live }}</ref> They are now one of the top ten immigrant groups in Boston, and the largest hailing from Africa. The first wave of Cape Verdean immigrants came to Massachusetts to work in the [[Whaling|whaling industry]].<ref name="":3"" /> When whaling declined, they moved into maritime jobs, seasonal agricultural work (like picking [[Cranberry|cranberries]]) , and factory work. The second wave of Cape Verdean immigrants arrived after Cape Verde gained independence in 1975. They also found work in factories, but as [[Deindustrialization|manufacturing plants closed down]], they moved into the service industry in the 1990s. Cape Verdean immigrants have also developed a vibrant small business sector, including restaurants, groceries, real estate and insurance offices, and other enterprises.<ref name="":3"" /> Cape Verdean immigrants in the U.S. have a long history of enlistment in the U.S. military, with a presence in every major conflict from the Revolutionary War to the Vietnam War.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cape Verdeans: Cape Verdean Veterans |url=http://sites.google.com/site/capeverdeanveterans/Home/Cape-Verdean-Veterans |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114072859/https://sites.google.com/site/capeverdeanveterans/Home/Cape-Verdean-Veterans |archive-date=14 November 2012 |website=Sites.google.com}}</ref>

Due to centuries of colonial ties, the second largest number of Cape Verdeans live in Portugal (150,000), with sizable communities in the former Portuguese colonies of Angola (45,000) and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] (25,000). Major populations exist in countries with cultural and linguistic similarities, such as Spain (65,500), France (25,000), Senegal (25,000), and Italy (20,000). Other large communities live in the United Kingdom (35,500), the Netherlands (20,000, of which 15,000 are concentrated in [[Rotterdam]]), and Luxembourg and Scandinavia (7,000). Outside the U.S. and Europe, the biggest Cape Verdean populations are in Mexico (5,000) and Argentina (8,000).

Over the years, Cape Verde has increasingly become a net recipient of migrants, due to its relatively high per capita income, political and social stability, and civil freedom.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Chinese make up a sizeable and important segment of the foreign population, while nearby West African countries account for most immigration. In the 21st century, a few thousand Europeans and Latin Americans have settled in the country, mostly professionals, entrepreneurs, and retirees. Over 22,000 foreign-born residents are naturalized, hailing from over 90 countries.

The Cape Verdean diaspora experience is reflected in many artistic and cultural expressions, most famously the song ''[[Sodade]]'' by [[Cesária Évora]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://qz.com/africa/1594655/cesaria-evoras-cape-verde-musical-legacy-lives-on/ |title=Cesaria, the unlikely heroine for the country that treasures her indomitable spirit |last=Kimeria |first=Ciku |website=Quartz Africa |date=13 April 2019 |access-date=7 September 2019 |archive-date=14 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414140414/https://qz.com/africa/1594655/cesaria-evoras-cape-verde-musical-legacy-lives-on/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to the latest data (2017) from the National Statistics Bureau,<ref name=""ine.cv"" /> life expectancy at birth in Cape Verde is 76.2 years; that is, 72.2 years for males and 80.2 years for females. There are six hospitals in the Cape Verde archipelago: two central hospitals (one in the capital city of Praia and one in Mindelo, São Vicente) and four regional hospitals (one in Santa Catarina (northern Santiago region), one on São Antão, one on Fogo, and one on Sal). In addition, there are 28 health centers, 35 sanitation centers, and a variety of private clinics located throughout the archipelago.

Cape Verde's population is among the healthiest in Africa. Since its independence, it has greatly improved its health indicators. Besides having been promoted to the group of ""medium development"" countries in 2007, leaving the [[least developed countries]] category (becoming the second country to do so<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=22918&Cr=cape&Cr1=verde ""UN advocate salutes Cape Verde's graduation from category of poorest States""] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024061915/http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=22918&Cr=cape&Cr1=verde |date=24 October 2017 }}, UN News Centre, 14 June 2007.</ref>), as of 2020 it was the [[List of African countries by Human Development Index|11th best ranked]] country in Africa in its [[Human Development Index]].

The total expenditure on health was 7.1% of GDP (2015).

=== Education ===

Cape Verde has one of the best educational systems in Africa, ranked 8th by the World Education Forum in 2023.<ref>https://bscholarly.com/countries-with-the-best-education-system-in-africa/</ref> Although the Cape Verdean educational system is similar to the Portuguese system, over the years the local universities have been increasingly adopting the American educational system; for instance, all ten existing universities in the country offer four-year bachelor's degree programs as opposed to five-year bachelor's degree programs that existed before 2010.

{{as of|2016|October|}}, there were 69 secondary schools throughout the archipelago (including 19 private secondary schools) and at least 10 universities in the country, which are based on the two islands of Santiago and São Vicente.
[[File:Universidade de Santiago.jpg|thumb|University of Santiago]]
In 2015, 23% of the Cape Verdean population had either attended or graduated from secondary schools.
When it came to higher education, 9% of Cape Verdean men and 8% of Cape Verdean women held a bachelor's degree or had attended universities. The overall college education rate (i.e., college graduates and undergraduate students) in Cape Verde is about 24%, of the local college-age population.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Instituto Nacional de Estatística Cabo Verde |url=https://www.ine.cv/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010220170818/http://www.ine.cv:80/ |archive-date=20 February 2001}}</ref>
The total expenditure on education was 5.6% of GDP (2010).
The mean years of schooling of adults over 25 years is 12.

These trends were held in 2017. Cape Verde stands out in West Africa for the quality and inclusiveness of its higher education system. As of 2017, one in four young people attended university and one-third of students opted for fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.<ref name=""UNESCO Science Report 2021"" /> Women made up one-third of students but two-thirds of graduates in 2018.<ref name=""UNESCO Science Report 2021"" />

In 2011, Cape Verde devoted just 0.07% of its GDP to research and development, among the lowest rates in West Africa. The Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Culture plan to strengthen the research and academic sectors by emphasizing greater mobility, through exchange programmes and international cooperation agreements.

Cape Verde counted 25 researchers in 2011, a researcher density of 51 per million inhabitants. The world average was 1,083 per million in 2013. All 25 researchers were working in the government sector in 2011 and one in three were women (36%). There was no research being conducted in either medical or agricultural sciences. Of the eight engineers involved in research and development, one was a woman. Three of the five researchers working in natural sciences were women, as were three of the six social scientists and two of the five researchers from the humanities.<ref name="":1"" />

In 2015, the government announced a project to build a technology park for business, research, and development. As of late 2020, the project, now named TechPark Cabo Verde, is slated for completion in June 2022. The project is funded by both the [[African Development Bank]] and the government of Cape Verde.

She was also referred to as ""The Queen of Morna""<ref>{{Cite news |last=Pareles |first=Jon |date=2011-12-19 |title=Cesária Évora, Singer From Cape Verde, Dies at 70 (Published 2011) |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/arts/music/cesaria-evora-morna-singer-from-cape-verde-dies.html |access-date=2021-01-13 |issn=0362-4331 |archive-date=19 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219234208/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/arts/music/cesaria-evora-morna-singer-from-cape-verde-dies.html |url-status=live }}</ref> as opposed to her uncle [[Bana (singer)|Bana]], who was referred to as ""King of Morna"". The international success of Cesária Évora has made other Cape Verdean artists, or descendants of Cape Verdeans born in Portugal, gain more space in the music market. Examples of this are singers [[Sara Tavares]], [[Lura (singer)|Lura]] and [[Mayra Andrade]].

Another great exponent of traditional music from Cape Verde was [[Antoninho Travadinha|Antonio Vicente Lopes]], better known as Travadinha, and [[Ildo Lobo]], who died in 2004. The House of Culture in the center of the city of Praia is called Ildo Lobo House of Culture, in his honour.

There are also well-known artists born to Cape Verdean parents who excelled themselves in the international music scene. Amongst these artists are jazz pianist [[Horace Silver]], [[Duke Ellington]]'s saxophonist [[Paul Gonsalves]], [[Teófilo Chantre]], [[Paul Pena]], the [[Tavares (group)|Tavares]] brothers and singer [[Lura (musician)|Lura]].

=== Dance ===
Cape Verdean traditional dance is a mix of West and Central African influences. The most popular dance style in Cape Verde is called “[[Funaná|Funana]]” which originated on the island of Santiago and is danced solo or in pairs with fast hip movements and a lively rhythm. Another popular dance style is “[[Coladeira]]” which is a slower dance style that originated on the island of Sao Vicente. “[[Batuque (music and dance)|Batuque]]” is another traditional Cape Verdean dance style that originated on the island of Santiago and involves a lot of hip movement and percussion. “[[Morna (music)|Morna]]” is another popular Cape Verdean dance style that originated on the island of Boa Vista and has a slow tempo with a melancholic melody. [[Zouk]] and [[Kizomba]] are newer popular dance style in Cape Verde that originated in other countries.

== Transport ==
{{Main|Transport in Cape Verde}}

=== Ports ===
[[File:CaisPortoNovo.JPG|thumb|Porto Novo harbour in Santo Antão]]
There are four international ports: [[Mindelo]], Praia, [[Palmeira, Cape Verde|Palmeira]] and [[Sal Rei]]. Mindelo on São Vicente is the main port for cruise ships and the terminus for the ferry service to Santo Antão. Praia on Santiago is the main hub for local ferry services to other islands. Palmeira on Sal supplies fuel for the main airport on the island, Amílcar Cabral International Airport, and is important for the hotel construction taking place on the island. [[Porto Novo, Cape Verde|Porto Novo]] on Santo Antão is the only source for imports and exports of produce from the island as well as passenger traffic since the closure of the airstrip at [[Ponta do Sol, Cape Verde|Ponta do Sol]].

There are smaller harbours, essentially single jetties at [[Tarrafal, Cape Verde|Tarrafal]] on São Nicolau, Sal Rei on Boa Vista, [[Porto Inglês|Vila do Maio (Porto Inglês)]] on Maio, [[São Filipe, Cape Verde|São Filipe]] on Fogo and [[Furna (Brava)|Furna]] on Brava. These act as terminals for the inter-island ferry services, which carry both freight and passengers. The pier at [[Santa Maria, Cape Verde|Santa Maria]] on Sal used by both fishing and dive boats has been rehabilitated.

=== Airports ===
{{Main|List of airports in Cape Verde}}
[[File:Aeroporto-Internacional-Aristides-Pereira-Terminal-2012.JPG|thumb|[[Aristides Pereira International Airport]] in Boa Vista island]]
There were seven operational airports {{as of|2014|lc=y}}&nbsp;– four international and three domestic. Two others were non-operational, one on Brava and the other on Santo Antão closed for safety reasons.

Due to its geographical location, Cape Verde is often flown over by transatlantic airliners. It is part of the conventional air traffic route from Europe to South America, which goes from southern Portugal via the [[Canary Islands]] and Cape Verde to northern Brazil.

Most of the Central African Republic consists of Sudano-Guinean [[savanna]]s, but the country also includes a [[Sahel]]o-[[East Sudanian savanna|Sudanian]] zone in the north and an [[Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic|equatorial forest zone]] in the south. Two-thirds of the country is within the [[Ubangi River]] basin (which flows into the [[Congo River|Congo]]), while the remaining third lies in the basin of the [[Chari River|Chari]], which flows into [[Lake Chad]].

What is today the Central African Republic has been inhabited since at least 8,000 BCE. The country's borders were established by France, which ruled the country as a colony starting in the late 19th century. After gaining independence from France in 1960, the Central African Republic was ruled by a series of autocratic leaders, including an [[Central African Empire|abortive attempt at a monarchy]].<ref name=""Bokassa"">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/03/jean-bedel-bokassa-posthumous-pardon 'Cannibal' dictator Bokassa given posthumous pardon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301025416/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/03/jean-bedel-bokassa-posthumous-pardon |date=1 March 2017 }}.

By the 1990s, calls for democracy led to the first multi-party democratic elections in 1993. [[Ange-Félix Patassé]] became president, but was later removed by [[François Bozizé|General François Bozizé]] in the [[2003 Central African Republic coup d'état|2003 coup]]. The [[Central African Republic Bush War]] began in 2004 and, despite a peace treaty in 2007 and another in 2011, civil war resumed in 2012. The civil war perpetuated the country's poor [[Human rights in the Central African Republic|human rights record]]: it was characterized by widespread and increasing abuses by various participating armed groups, such as arbitrary imprisonment, torture, and restrictions on freedom of the press and freedom of movement.

The Central African Republic is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]], the [[Economic Community of Central African States]], the {{Lang|fr|[[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]]|italic=no}} and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

== Etymology ==
The name of the Central African Republic is derived from the country's geographical location in the central region of Africa and its republican form of government. From 1976 to 1979, the country was known as the [[Central African Empire]].

During the colonial era, the country's name was [[Ubangi-Shari]] ({{Lang-fr|Oubangui-Chari}}), a name derived from the [[Ubangi River]] and the [[Chari River]]. [[Barthélemy Boganda]], the country's first [[List of heads of government of the Central African Republic|prime minister]], favored the name ""Central African Republic"" over Ubangi-Shari, reportedly because he envisioned [[United States of Latin Africa|a larger union of countries]] in [[Central Africa]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Palmer |first=Brian |date=9 March 2012 |title=Why Does the Central African Republic Have Such a Boring Name? |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2012/03/joseph-kony-video-why-does-central-african-republic-have-such-a-boring-name.html |website=Slate}}</ref>

After Boganda's death in a plane crash on 29 March 1959, his cousin, [[David Dacko]], took control of MESAN.

On 31 December 1965, Dacko was overthrown in the [[Saint-Sylvestre coup d'état]] by Colonel [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], who suspended the constitution and dissolved the National Assembly. President Bokassa declared himself President for Life in 1972 and named himself Emperor Bokassa I of the [[Central African Empire]] (as the country was renamed) on 4 December 1976. A year later, Emperor Bokassa crowned himself in a lavish and expensive ceremony that was ridiculed by much of the world.<ref name=Bokassa/>

In April 1979, young students protested against Bokassa's decree that all school pupils were required to buy uniforms from a company owned by one of his wives. The government violently suppressed the protests, killing 100 children and teenagers. Bokassa might have been personally involved in some of the killings.<ref>""[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7803421.stm 'Good old days' under Bokassa?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203043924/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7803421.stm |date=3 December 2013 }}"".

==== Central African Republic under Kolingba ====
Kolingba suspended the constitution and ruled with a [[military junta]] until 1985. He introduced a new constitution in 1986 which was adopted by a nationwide referendum. Membership in his new party, the [[Rassemblement Démocratique Centrafricain]] (RDC), was voluntary. In 1987 and 1988, semi-free elections to parliament were held, but Kolingba's two major political opponents, [[Abel Goumba]] and [[Ange-Félix Patassé]], were not allowed to participate.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#Why-Visit|title=Central African Republic – Discover World|website=www.discoverworld.com|access-date=10 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210180433/https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#Why-Visit|archive-date=10 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

By 1990, inspired by the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], a pro-democracy movement arose. Pressure from the United States, France, and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR (France, the US, Germany, Japan, the EU, the [[World Bank]], and the UN) finally led Kolingba to agree, in principle, to hold free elections in October 1992 with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs. After using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power, President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a ""Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la République"" (Provisional National Political Council, CNPPR) and to set up a ""Mixed Electoral Commission"", which included representatives from all political parties.<ref name="":0"" />

When a second round of elections were finally held in 1993, again with the help of the international community coordinated by GIBAFOR, Ange-Félix Patassé won in the second round of voting with 53% of the vote while Goumba won 45.6%. Patassé's party, the ''Mouvement pour la Libération du Peuple Centrafricain'' (MLPC) or Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People, gained a [[Plurality voting|plurality]] (relative majority) but not an [[Majority|absolute majority]] of seats in parliament, which meant Patassé's party required coalition partners.<ref name="":0"" />

==== Patassé government (1993–2003) ====
Patassé purged many of the Kolingba elements from the government and Kolingba supporters accused Patassé's government of conducting a ""[[Witch-hunt#Figurative use of the term|witch hunt]]"" against the Yakoma. A new constitution was approved on 28 December 1994 but had little impact on the country's politics. In 1996–1997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behavior, three [[Mutiny|mutinies]] against Patassé's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. During this time (1996), the [[Peace Corps]] evacuated all its volunteers to neighboring Cameroon. To date, the Peace Corps has not returned to the Central African Republic. The [[Bangui Agreements]], signed in January 1997, provided for the deployment of an inter-African military mission, to the Central African Republic and re-entry of ex-mutineers into the government on 7 April 1997. The inter-African military mission was later replaced by a U.N. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1159|peacekeeping force (MINURCA)]]. Since 1997, the country has hosted almost a dozen peacekeeping interventions, earning it the title of ""world champion of peacekeeping"".<ref name=fp1015/>

In 1998, parliamentary elections resulted in Kolingba's RDC winning 20 out of 109 seats. The next year, however, in spite of widespread public anger in urban centers over his corrupt rule, Patassé won a second term in the presidential election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisa.org.za/wep/car1999results.htm|title=EISA Central African Republic: 1999 Presidential election results|date=October 2010|website=www.eisa.org.za|publisher=African Democracy Encyclopaedia Project|access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref>

On 28 May 2001, rebels stormed strategic buildings in Bangui in an [[2001 Central African Republic coup d'état attempt|unsuccessful coup attempt]]. The army chief of staff, Abel Abrou, and General François N'Djadder Bedaya were killed, but Patassé regained the upper hand by bringing in at least 300 troops of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] rebel leader [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] and Libyan soldiers.<ref>{{Cite web|author=International Crisis Group|title=Central African Republic: Anatomy of a Phantom State|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/central-africa/central-african-republic/Central%20African%20Republic%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20Phantom%20State.pdf|website=CrisisGroup.org|publisher=International Crisis Group|access-date=24 July 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626162538/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/central-africa/central-african-republic/Central%20African%20Republic%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20Phantom%20State.pdf|archive-date=26 June 2014}}</ref>

In the aftermath of the [[2001 Central African Republic coup d'état attempt|failed coup]], militias loyal to Patassé sought revenge against rebels in many neighborhoods of [[Bangui]] and incited unrest including the murder of many political opponents. Eventually, Patassé came to suspect that General [[François Bozizé]] was involved in another coup attempt against him, which led Bozizé to flee with loyal troops to Chad. In March 2003, Bozizé launched a surprise attack against Patassé, who was out of the country. Libyan troops and some 1,000 soldiers of Bemba's Congolese rebel organization failed to stop the rebels and Bozizé's forces succeeded in overthrowing Patassé.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#History|title=Central African Republic History|date=2018|website=DiscoverWorld.com|access-date=15 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210180433/https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#History|archive-date=10 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Syrte Agreement in February and the Birao Peace Agreement in April 2007 called for a cessation of hostilities, the billeting of [[Democratic Front of the Central African People|FDPC]] fighters and their integration with FACA, the liberation of political prisoners, integration of FDPC into government, an amnesty for the [[Union of Democratic Forces for Unity|UFDR]], its recognition as a political party, and the integration of its fighters into the national army. Several groups continued to fight but other groups signed on to the agreement, or similar agreements with the government (e.g. UFR on 15 December 2008). The only major group not to sign an agreement at the time was the [[Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace|CPJP]], which continued its activities and signed a peace agreement with the government on 25 August 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |title=PA-X: Peace Agreements Database |url=https://www.peaceagreements.org/view/807 |access-date=2023-01-19 |website=www.peaceagreements.org}}</ref>

The [[per capita income]] of the Republic is often listed as being approximately $400 a year, [[List of countries by GNI (PPP) per capita|one of the lowest in the world]], but this figure is based mostly on reported sales of exports and largely ignores the unregistered sale of foods, locally produced [[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[diamond]]s, [[ivory]], [[bushmeat]], and [[traditional medicine]].<ref name="":2"">{{Cite journal|date=19 June 2019|title=Central African Republic – Systematic Country Diagnostic : Priorities for Ending Poverty and Boosting Shared Prosperity|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/459721563221464687/Central-African-Republic-Systematic-Country-Diagnostic-Priorities-for-Ending-Poverty-and-Boosting-Shared-Prosperity|journal=[[The World Bank]]|language=en|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=1–96|via=documents.worldbank.org/}}</ref>

The currency of the Central African Republic is the [[Central African CFA franc|CFA franc]], which is accepted across the former countries of [[French West Africa]] and trades at a fixed rate to the euro. Diamonds constitute the country's most important export, accounting for 40–55% of export revenues, but it is estimated that between 30% and 50% of those produced each year leave the country clandestinely.<ref name="":2"" />
On 27 April 2022,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Central African Republic adopts bitcoin as legal currency |url=https://news.yahoo.com/central-african-republic-adopts-bitcoin-104407031.html |access-date=28 April 2022 |website=news.yahoo.com |language=en-US}}</ref> [[Bitcoin]] (BTC) was adopted as an additional legal tender. Lawmakers unanimously adopted a bill that made Bitcoin legal tender alongside the CFA franc and legalized the use of cryptocurrencies. President [[Faustin-Archange Touadéra]] signed the measure into law, said his chief of staff Obed Namsio.

Agriculture is dominated by the cultivation and sale of food crops such as [[cassava]], [[peanut]]s, [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[sesame]], and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]. The annua [[Economic growth|growth rate]] of real GDP is slightly above 3%. The importance of food crops over exported [[cash crops]] is indicated by the fact that the total production of cassava, the staple food of most Central Africans, ranges between 200,000 and 300,000 [[tonnes]] a year, while the production of [[cotton]], the principal exported cash crop, ranges from 25,000 to 45,000 tonnes a year. Food crops are not exported in large quantities, but still constitute the principal cash crops of the country because Central Africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus food crops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or coffee.<ref name="":2"" /> Much of the country is self-sufficient in food crops; however, [[livestock]] development is hindered by the presence of the [[tsetse fly]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gouteux|first1=J.

The Central African Republic is a member of the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] (OHADA). In the 2009 [[World Bank Group]]'s report ''Doing Business'', it was ranked 183rd of 183 as regards 'ease of doing business', a [[Composite (finance)|composite index]] which takes into account regulations that enhance business activity and those that restrict it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Doing Business 2010.

Chad has a population of 16 million, of which 1.6 million live in the [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city of [[N'Djamena]].

Chad has several regions: a [[desert]] zone in the north, an arid [[Sahel]]ian belt in the centre and a more fertile [[Sudanian Savanna]] zone in the south. [[Lake Chad]], after which the country is named, is the second-largest [[wetland]] in Africa.

Beginning in the 7th millennium BC, human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers. By the end of the 1st millennium AD, a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of [[French Equatorial Africa]]. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of [[François Tombalbaye]]. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting [[Chadian Civil War (1965–1979)|civil war]] in 1965. In 1979 [[Transitional Government of National Unity (Chad)|the rebels]] conquered the capital and put an end to the South's hegemony. The rebel commanders then fought amongst themselves until [[Hissène Habré]] defeated his rivals. The [[Chadian–Libyan conflict]] erupted in 1978 by the Libyan invasion which stopped in 1987 with a French military intervention ([[Operation Épervier]]). Hissène Habré was overthrown in turn in 1990 by his general [[Idriss Déby]]. With French support, a modernization of the [[Chad National Army]] was initiated in 1991. From 2003, the [[War in Darfur|Darfur crisis]] in Sudan spilt over the border and [[Chadian Civil War (2005–2010)|destabilised the nation]]. Already poor, the nation and people struggled to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of [[Sudanese refugees]] who live in and around camps in eastern Chad.

While many political parties participated in Chad's legislature, the [[National Assembly (Chad)|National Assembly]], power laid firmly in the hands of the [[Patriotic Salvation Movement]] during the presidency of Idriss Déby, whose rule was described as [[authoritarian]].<ref>{{cite web|date=8 April 2016|title=Chad's authoritarian Deby unwilling to quit|url=https://www.dw.com/en/chads-authoritarian-deby-unwilling-to-quit/a-19173621|access-date=4 August 2020|website=Deutsche Welle|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Haynes |first=Suyin|date=28 March 2019|title=This African Country Has Had a Yearlong Ban on Social Media.

Chad ranks the 2nd lowest in the [[Human Development Index]], with 0.394 in 2021 placed 190th, and a [[least developed countries|least developed country]] facing the effects of being one of the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|poorest]] and [[Corruption Perceptions Index|most corrupt]] countries in the world. Most of its inhabitants live in poverty as [[Agriculture in Chad|subsistence herders and farmers]]. Since 2003 crude oil has become the country's primary source of export earnings, superseding the traditional cotton industry. Chad has a poor [[Human rights in Chad|human rights record]], with frequent abuses such as arbitrary imprisonment, extrajudicial killings, and limits on civil liberties by both security forces and armed militias.

== History ==
{{main|History of Chad}}

=== Early history ===
In the [[7th millennium BC]], ecological conditions in the northern half of Chadian territory favored human settlement, and its population increased considerably. Some of the most important [[African archaeology|African archaeological]] sites are found in Chad, mainly in the [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region]]; some date to earlier than 2000 BC.<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 44–45</ref><ref name=""Collelo"">S. Collelo, ''Chad''</ref>

[[File:Group of Kanem-Bu warriors.jpg|thumb|Group of Kanem-Bu warriors. The [[Kanem–Bornu Empire]] controlled almost all of what is today Chad.|left]]

For more than 2,000 years, the Chadian Basin has been inhabited by agricultural and [[sedentism|sedentary]] people. The region became a crossroads of civilizations. The earliest of these was the legendary [[Sao civilisation|Sao]], known from artifacts and oral histories. The Sao fell to the [[Kanem Empire]],<ref name=Lange88>D. Lange 1988</ref><ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], p. 6</ref> the first and longest-lasting of the empires that developed in Chad's [[Sahel]]ian strip by the end of the 1st millennium AD. Two other states in the region, [[Sultanate of Bagirmi]] and [[Wadai Empire]], emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. The power of Kanem and its successors was based on control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region.<ref name=""Collelo""/> These states, at least tacitly [[Islam in Africa|Muslim]], never extended their control to the southern grasslands except to raid for slaves.<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 7–8</ref> In Kanem, about a third of the population were slaves.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |title=Welcome to Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=29 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006131931/https://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |archive-date=6 October 2014}}</ref>

=== French colonial period (1900–1960) ===
French colonial expansion led to the creation of the {{lang|fr|Territoire Militaire des Pays et Protectorats du Tchad}} in 1900. By 1920, France had secured full control of the colony and incorporated it as part of [[French Equatorial Africa]].<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 8, 309</ref> [[Colonial Chad|French rule in Chad]] was characterised by an absence of policies to unify the territory and sluggish modernisation compared to other French colonies.<ref name=""Decalo, pp. 8–9"">[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 8–9</ref>

The French primarily viewed the colony as an unimportant source of untrained labour and raw cotton; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929. The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed and had to rely on the dregs of the French civil service. Only the [[Sara people|Sara]] of the south was governed effectively; French presence in the Islamic north and east was nominal. The educational system was affected by this neglect.<ref name=""Collelo""/><ref name=""Decalo, pp. 8–9""/>

After [[World War II]], France granted Chad the status of [[Overseas France|overseas territory]] and its inhabitants the right to elect representatives to the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] and a [[National Assembly (Chad)|Chadian assembly]]. The largest political party was the [[Chadian Progressive Party]] ({{lang-fr|Parti Progressiste Tchadien}}, PPT), based in the southern half of the colony. Chad was granted independence on 11 August 1960 with the PPT's leader, [[François Tombalbaye]], an ethnic [[Sara people|Sara]], as its first [[Heads of state of Chad|president]].<ref name=""Collelo""/><ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 248–249</ref><ref>[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 17</ref>

=== Tombalbaye rule (1960–1979) ===
Two years later, Tombalbaye banned opposition parties and established a one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and insensitive mismanagement exacerbated inter-ethnic tensions. In 1965, Muslims in the north, led by the [[FROLINAT|National Liberation Front of Chad]] ({{lang-fr|Front de libération nationale du Tchad}}, FRONILAT), began a [[Transitional Government of National Unity (Chad)|civil war]]. Tombalbaye was [[1975 Chadian coup d'état|overthrown and killed]] in 1975,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012172429/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917376,00.html ""Death of a Dictator""], ''Time'', (28 April 1975).

Armed factions, many from the north's rebellion, contended for power.<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 12–16</ref><ref>[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 268</ref>

=== Déby lineage & democracy with second Civil War (1990–present) ===
[[File:Idriss Déby at the White House in 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Despite internal political opposition, coup attempts, and a civil war, [[Idriss Déby]] continuously ruled Chad from 1990 until his death in 2021.]]

Déby attempted to reconcile the rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a [[Constitution of Chad|new constitution]] by [[Chadian constitutional referendum, 1996|referendum]], and in 1996, Déby easily won a [[Chadian presidential election, 1996|competitive presidential election]]. He won a [[Chadian presidential election, 2001|second term]] five years later.<ref>East, Roger & Richard J. Thomas (2003); ''Profiles of People in Power: The World's Government Leaders''. Routledge. {{ISBN|1-85743-126-X}}, p. 100</ref> [[Petroleum|Oil]] exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would, at last, have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a [[War in Chad (2005–present)|new civil war]] broke out. Déby [[Chadian constitutional referendum, 2005|unilaterally modified the constitution]] to remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties.<ref>IPS, ""{{lang|fr|Le pétrole au cœur des nouveaux soubresauts au Tchad}}""</ref>

In 2006 Déby won [[Chadian presidential election, 2006|a third mandate]] in elections that the opposition boycotted.

Chad has more than 200 distinct ethnic groups,<ref name=""BGN""/> which create diverse social structures. The colonial administration and independent governments have attempted to impose a national society, but for most Chadians the local or regional society remains the most important influence outside the immediate family. Nevertheless, Chad's people may be classified according to the geographical region in which they live.<ref name=""Collelo""/><ref name=""EB""/>

In the south live sedentary people such as the [[Sara people|Sara]], the nation's main ethnic group, whose essential [[social unit]] is the lineage. In the Sahel sedentary peoples live side by side with nomadic ones, such as the Arabs, the country's second major ethnic group. The north is inhabited by nomads, mostly [[Toubous]].<ref name=""Collelo""/><ref name=""EB""/>

=== Languages ===
{{main|Languages of Chad}}
Chad's official languages are [[Arabic]] and [[French language|French]], but over 100 languages are spoken. The [[Chadic languages|Chadic branch]] of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] [[language family]] gets its name from Chad, and is represented by dozens of languages native to the country. Chad is also home to [[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic]], [[Maban languages|Maban]], and several [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] languages. 

Due to the important role played by itinerant Arab traders and settled merchants in local communities, [[Chadian Arabic]] has become a [[lingua franca]].<ref name=""Collelo"" />

=== Education ===
[[Education in Chad|Educators]] face considerable challenges due to the nation's dispersed population and a certain degree of reluctance on the part of parents to send their children to school. Although attendance is compulsory, only 68 percent of boys attend primary school, and more than half of the population is illiterate.

== Government and politics ==
{{main|Politics of Chad}}
[[file:Chadian woman voting during the 2016 presidential election.jpg|thumb|Chadian woman voting during the 2016 presidential election]]
Chad's constitution provides for a strong executive branch headed by a president who dominates the political system. The president has the power to appoint the [[Prime Minister of Chad|prime minister]] and the cabinet, and exercises considerable influence over appointments of judges, generals, provincial officials and heads of Chad's para-statal firms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chad 1996 (rev. 2005)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Chad_2005?lang=en#286|website=Constitute|access-date=22 April 2015}}</ref> In cases of grave and immediate threat, the president, in consultation with the [[National Assembly (Chad)|National Assembly]], may declare a [[state of emergency]].

Chad's legal system is based on [[law of France|French civil law]] and Chadian customary law where the latter does not interfere with public order or constitutional guarantees of equality. Despite the constitution's guarantee of judicial independence, the president names most key judicial officials. The legal system's highest jurisdictions, the [[Supreme Court of Chad|Supreme Court]] and the [[Constitutional Council of Chad|Constitutional Council]], have become fully operational since 2000. The Supreme Court is made up of a chief justice, named by the president, and 15 councillors, appointed for life by the president and the National Assembly. The Constitutional Court is headed by nine judges elected to nine-year terms. It has the power to review legislation, treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption.<ref name=""BGN""/><ref name=""UNPACP""/>

The National Assembly makes legislation. The body consists of 155 members elected for four-year terms who meet three times per year. The Assembly holds regular sessions twice a year, starting in March and October, and can hold special sessions when called by the prime minister. Deputies elect a National Assembly president every two years. The president must sign or reject newly passed laws within 15 days. The National Assembly must approve the prime minister's plan of government and may force the prime minister to resign through a majority vote of no confidence. However, if the National Assembly rejects the executive branch's programme twice in one year, the president may disband the Assembly and call for new legislative elections. In practice, the president exercises considerable influence over the National Assembly through his party, the [[Patriotic Salvation Movement]] (MPS), which holds a large majority.<ref name=""BGN""/>

Until the legalisation of opposition parties in 1992, Déby's MPS was the sole legal party in Chad.<ref name=""BGN""/> Since then, [[list of political parties in Chad|78 registered political parties]] have become active.<ref name=""HRP"">""[https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78726.htm Chad]"".

=== Cuisine ===
{{main|Cuisine of Chad}}
[[Millet]] is the staple food of [[Chadian cuisine]]. It is used to make balls of paste that are dipped in sauces. In the north this dish is known as ''alysh''; in the south, as ''biya''. Fish is popular, which is generally prepared and sold either as ''salanga'' (sun-dried and lightly smoked ''[[Alestes]]'' and ''[[Hydrocynus]]'') or as ''banda'' (smoked large fish).<ref>""[http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/D7238E/D7238E03.htm Symposium on the evaluation of fishery resources in the development and management of inland fisheries]"".

=== Music ===
{{main|Music of Chad}}
The [[music of Chad]] includes a number of instruments such as the ''kinde'', a type of bow harp; the ''[[kakaki]]'', a long tin horn; and the ''hu hu'', a stringed instrument that uses [[calabash]]es as loudspeakers.

The music group [[Chari Jazz]] formed in 1964 and initiated Chad's modern music scene. Later, more renowned groups such as African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity and tradition. Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on ''sai'', a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists. Piracy and a lack of legal protections for artists' rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry.<ref name=""culture""/><ref>* {{in lang|fr}} Gondjé, Laoro (2003); ""[http://www.cefod.org/archives/spip.php?article231 {{lang|fr|La musique recherche son identité}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422134754/http://www.cefod.org/archives/spip.php?article231 |date=22 April 2014 }}"", {{lang|fr|Tchad et Culture}} '''214'''.</ref>
